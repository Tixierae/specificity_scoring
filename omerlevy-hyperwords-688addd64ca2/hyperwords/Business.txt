Rugby fans are 'marketing goldmine'

LONDON: As the annual Six Nations rugby tournament prepares to kick off on Saturday, marketers have a unique opportunity to reach a wealthy demographic if they set about it in the right way.

"Rugby fans are a marketing goldmine," according to Craig Tuck, UK managing director at martech business RadiumOne. "Incomes are at least 20% higher than UK average, 71% are social grade AB and they're more likely to respond to advertising across key sectors such as business, finance and automotive."

Canny marketers will look beyond the 125m-strong television audience to tap into fans' digital engagement with the game. RadiumOne's research indicates that every month 7.7 million fans engage with rugby content online and nearly half of rugby fans share content, doing so 2.8 times a day.

The majority (78%) of this sharing, it added, happens via 'dark social' channels, such as email, text and instant messaging, which can't be measured via web analytics; just 14% of sharing takes place on Facebook and 6% on Twitter.

But rugby fans sharing content via dark social are six times more likely to engage with Six Nations, which "proves how powerful it is for marketers because sharing this way carries more weight as its done on a 1-2-1 basis with family or close friends, rather than the 'blanket' approach on social networks," said Tuck.

"The likes of O2, IBM, MasterCard and Guinness have utilised dark social to great effect," he added. (Readers can download a summary chapter from Warc's Toolkit 2017 on what the rise of dark social and chart apps means for marketers.)

Mobile will be key in 2017, as the volume of Six Nations content shared via this channel has almost doubled, from 28% in 2016 to 47% in the run-up to this year's competition.

There are major differences around the type of Six Nations content shared publicly and privately, RadiumOne noted: fixtures and results dominate dark social sharing, accounting for 56%, followed by the tournament table (31%).

However, the most popular content shared publicly is the TV/coverage schedule (42%) and team news (38%).

"Understanding these differences can help marketers target fans with paid media more effectively," Tuck stated.

Last year RBS, the UK bank, announced it was ending its long-running association with the tournament, and the organisers recently indicated they were seeking a global sponsor prepared to pay £100m over six years.

"We want a sponsor who is actively engaged not just in Britain, but around the world," explained Six Nations chief executive John Feehan. "We see potential in markets like the USA. We want a brand to align with that."

Data sourced from RadiumOne, MailOnline; additional content by Warc staff The British Columbia Securities Commission (BCSC) has found the sole director and officer of Hornby Residence Ltd., perpetrated fraud on an investor in 2009.

According to the BCSC, Brendan James Schouw convinced an investor to invest $1 million into a Vancouver real estate project promising 18 per cent simple interest, which he would earn back over time.

It was found by the BCSC panel that after depositing the investor’s money into the company’s bank account, Schouw then redirected some of the funds to his personal account.

The panel also said that Schouw spent just under $100,000 of the investor’s money on his personal mortgage and his separate property management business, despite promising the investor that his money would be used exclusively for the development of a Vancouver real estate project.

In a press release announcing the panel’s decision they noted, “Seventy-five thousand dollars of [the investor’s] investment was diverted from its investment purpose. Those funds were both put at risk and ultimately lost.”

The larger claims by the Executive Director of the BCSC, alleging that Schouw improperly diverted upwards of $440,000 of the investor’s funds, was dismissed by the panel.

Hearings will be held over the coming months to determine the punishment for Schouw. Os beneficiários desta faixa poderão comprar imóveis de até R$ 300 mil, utilizando financiamento com recursos originados no FGTS, a juros anuais de 9,16%

Brasília - O governo federal prepara a criação da faixa 4 do programa habitacional Minha Casa Minha Vida (MCMV), destinado a famílias com renda mensal de até R$ 9 mil, conforme apurou o Broadcast, do Grupo Estado, com fontes próximas do assunto. Hoje, o limite é de R$ 6,5 mil.

Os beneficiários deste novo segmento poderão comprar imóveis de até R$ 300 mil, utilizando financiamento com recursos originados no Fundo de Garantia do Tempo de Serviço (FGTS) a juros anuais de 9,16%. Essa taxa é maior do que nas outras faixas do MCMV, que chegam a 8,16% ao ano. Entretanto, é mais atrativa do que os valores cobrados pelos bancos fora do programa, que vão de 10% a 14% ao ano.

A medida será anunciada na segunda-feira, em evento com a participação do presidente, Michel Temer, além de ministros e empresários.

Outra novidade será a correção nos limites de renda nas demais faixas do programa em cerca de 6,5%, visando acompanhar a inflação. Com isso, a renda mensal máxima das famílias para enquadramento na faixa 1,5 deve subir de R$ 2,3 mil para aproximadamente R$ 2,6 mil; na faixa 2 de R$ 3,6 mil para R$ 3,9 mil; e na faixa 3 de R$ 6,5 mil para R$ 7 mil.

Esses números ainda estão sendo ajustados e arredondados pelo governo federal, podendo ter algumas alterações no anúncio de segunda-feira. Também não está confirmada se a correção abrangerá a faixa 1, válido para famílias com renda de até R$ 1,8 mil. Neste segmento, o imóvel é praticamente todo pago com dinheiro do Tesouro Nacional. Snap, la maison-mère de la populaire messagerie mobile Snapchat, a officialisé jeudi son très attendu projet d'entrée en Bourse, qui pourrait être l'un des plus gros lancements à Wall Street depuis celui du chinois Alibaba en septembre 2014.

Dans le document publié jeudi sur le site internet du gendarme boursier américain (SEC), Snap se fixe l'objectif provisoire de lever jusqu'à 3 milliards de dollars.

Ce montant est uniquement utilisé pour l'instant afin de calculer les frais d'enregistrement et il évoluera quand le nombre exact de titres et leur prix d'introduction sera fixé, mais il donne déjà une idée de l'importance de l'opération.

Snap mise sur une introduction en Bourse dès le mois de mars et pourrait alors être valorisé entre 20 et 25 milliards de dollars, selon des sources. Cela représenterait la valorisation la plus élevée pour une IPO dans le secteur des hautes technologies aux Etats-Unis depuis celle de Facebook, dont le service concurrent Instagram compte 600 millions d'utilisateurs actifs.

Ses premiers pas sur le marché seront d'autant plus suivis qu'ils pourraient servir à prendre la température et peut-être convaincre d'autres candidats potentiels pour Wall Street, comme Airbnb, Spotify ou Uber par exemple. Ces startups très en vue partagent en effet avec Snap des valorisations très élevées, dans lesquelles certains observateurs dénoncent une nouvelle «bulle» du secteur technologique.

Trip Chowdhry, analyste chez Global Equities Research, conseillait ainsi encore récemment de rester à l'écart de l'entrée en Bourse de Snapchat, à la valeur selon lui «hyper gonflée» comme avant lui Zynga, Groupon, FitBit ou GoPro, dont les performances boursières se sont avérées décevantes, ou pour les investisseurs spéculatifs de revendre les titres à la première occasion.

Nasdaq boudé

Vu le délai que l'entreprise doit désormais respecter avant d'entamer son «roadshow», la tournée officielle de présentation aux investisseurs qui précède l'entrée en Bourse, Snap est désormais en position pour faire ses premiers pas sur le marché en mars.

Comme Twitter ou Alibaba avant lui, Snap a préféré se lancer sur le New York Stock Exchange plutôt que sur la plateforme électronique Nasdaq. Celle-ci a longtemps été considérée comme une destination évidente pour les entreprises du secteur technologique, mais sa réputation a été écornée ces dernières années par une série de problèmes techniques.

Une autre décision surprenante de l'entreprise est son choix de mettre sur le marché des actions qui ne seront assorties d'aucun droit de vote. Cela permettra de maintenir le contrôle effectif de Snap aux mains de ses co-fondateurs Evan Spiegel (directeur général) et Bobby Murphy (directeur technique), qui se partagent aujourd'hui 88,6% des droits de vote. Toutefois ce qui ne s'était encore jamais vu pour une introduction en Bourse à Wall Street pourrait susciter la défiance de certains investisseurs.

Hausse des utilisateurs

Le groupe basé à Los Angeles a annoncé avoir réalisé un chiffre d'affaires 2016 de 404,5 millions de dollars, contre 58,7 millions en 2015, avec une augmentation de 48% de son nombre d'utilisateurs actifs à 158 millions. Malgré cette forte croissance, l'exercice s'est soldé par une perte de 514,6 millions de dollars à comparer à un résultat négatif de 372,9 millions en 2015.

Snapchat a acquis une grande popularité auprès des adolescents et des jeunes adultes grâce à ses messages qui disparaissent peu après avoir été vus par leurs destinataires, et revendique 168 millions d'utilisateurs quotidiens. Il est considéré par beaucoup d'analystes comme l'ennemi numéro un pour Facebook, justement en raison de sa capacité à lui «voler» ce jeune public très recherché.

L'entreprise d'Evan Spiegel avait aussi lancé l'an dernier des lunettes connectées et équipées d'une caméra miniature («Spectacles»). La société qui a triplé ses effectifs l'an dernier à 1859 salariés avait décidé à cette occasion de se rebaptiser Snap afin de montrer qu'elle ne se limitait plus à un seul produit.

Cybersecurity firm FireEye Inc (FEYE.O) reported its first drop in quarterly revenue and forecast current-quarter billings well below analysts' estimates, sending its shares down as much as 20 percent.

FireEye, which provides web, email and malware security to businesses and governments, also said both its chairman and chief financial officer would leave, a setback for the company as it shifts its business to a cloud-based model.

Chairman David DeWalt, who stepped down as chief executive last year, led the company as it handled a string of high-profile data breaches over the last few years.

Chief Financial Officer Mike Berry is leaving the company to take up a similar role at another company. Frank Verdecanna, FireEye's chief accounting officer, will replace Berry.

The company forecast revenue of $160 million-$166 million for the current quarter, missing the average analyst estimate of $176.6 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

FireEye said it expects first-quarter billings - a closely watched indicator of future business - in the range of $130 million to $150 million, well below the average estimate of $186.3 million, according to research firm FactSet StreetAccount.

Vacancies in the company's sales teams affected revenue in the fourth quarter, Chief Executive Officer Kevin Mandia said on a conference call.

Key positions, including heads of the worldwide and Europe sales teams, were vacant during the second half of last year, Mandia said. The positions have since been filled.

Billings fell 14 percent in the fourth quarter to $221.8 million, hurt by lower-than-expected product sales.

Analysts on average had estimated billings of $240.3 million, according to FactSet.

The company's revenue fell for the first time since its market debut in 2013 to $184.7 million, missing the average estimate of $191 million.

Excluding items, FireEye reported a loss of 3 cents per share, beating the average estimate of a loss of 16 cents, helped by lower expenses.

Net loss attributable to shareholders more than halved to $61.5 million, or 37 cents per share, from $136.1 million, or 87 cents per share.

(Reporting by Narottam Medhora in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta and Saumyadeb Chakrabarty) CHICAGO A group of U.S. chicken farmers sued the country's biggest poultry processors, including Tyson Foods Inc, for allegedly conspiring to depress their pay, the latest accusation of improper collusion in the sector.

Tyson, Pilgrim's Pride Co, Sanderson Farms Inc and other companies illegally agreed to share detailed data on grower pay with one another to keep compensation below competitive levels, according to the civil lawsuit filed last Friday in a federal court in Oklahoma.

Sanderson Farms said in a regulatory filing on Thursday that the company plans to fight the lawsuit.

Tyson, the largest U.S. chicken company, called the allegations "false claims."

"We want our contract farmers to succeed and don't consult competitors about how our farmers are paid," Tyson spokesman Gary Mickelson said.

Perdue Farms declined to comment while representatives of the other companies that were sued - Pilgrim's Pride and Koch Foods - could not immediately be reached for comment after normal business hours.

The companies, which the lawsuit refers to as a "cartel," frequently shared data on pay with each other to keep compensation lower than it would have been in a competitive market, according to the lawsuit. That allowed the companies to keep more profits, the complaint said.

The companies also agreed not to compete for the services of farmers working for each in order to insulate themselves "from normal competitive pressures that could potentially erode the effects of their information sharing agreement," according to the lawsuit.

The farmers want to be paid monetary damages.

Overall, about 25,000 U.S. farmers have production contracts with chicken processors, according to the National Chicken Council, a trade group. They produce meat to feed consumers who spend about $90 billion annually on chicken.

Tyson said its average contract farmer has been raising chickens for the company for 15 years. Compensation "is set out clearly in contracts the farmers voluntarily enter into," according to the company.

The lawsuit comes after the U.S. Department of Agriculture in December proposed rules it said would make it easier for chicken producers to sue processors if they believed they were being mistreated.

The Trump administration has since frozen the rule, as officials review regulations proposed toward the end of former President Obama's last term in office.

A lawsuit last year alleged that Tyson had colluded with other companies in the broiler chicken business to reduce production since 2008. Tyson disputed the allegations at the time.

The case over pay is Haff Poultry Inc et al v Tyson Foods Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Oklahoma, No. 17-CV-00033.

(Additional reporting by Karl Plume in Chicago; editing by Jonathan Oatis, G Crosse) Denkt an eine Steuerreform: Finanzminister Wolfgang Schäuble.

Berlin. Donald Trump hat bereits angekündigt, die Steuern für Unternehmen in den USA zu senken. Auch Premierministerin Theresa May droht damit, Großbritannien in eine Steueroase zu verwandeln, wenn die Austrittsverhandlungen mit der EU schlecht laufen. Die deutsche Politik setzt das unter Druck. Die Frage steht im Raum: Soll sich die Bundesregierung auf einen Steuerwettbewerb einlassen und ebenfalls die Belastung reduzieren?

Für den Wirtschaftsrat der CDU, eine einflussreiche parteinahe Vereinigung mit 11.000 Mitgliedern, ist die Sache klar: "Wir müssen ganz klare Botschaften nach Washington und London senden", sagt der Generalsekretär des Unternehmerverbands, Wolfgang Steiger, unserer Redaktion. Und die sollten lauten: "Wenn ihr die Steuern senkt, ziehen wir nach!"

EU arbeitet an einheitlicher Besteuerung

In einem Positionspapier zur Steuerpolitik, das dieser Redaktion vorliegt, spricht sich der Wirtschaftsrat sehr klar für sehr schnelle Gegenreaktionen aus. "Wenn die USA und Großbritannien einen Unterbietungswettbewerb bei den Unternehmenssteuern starten, wirft das internationale Bemühungen und Vereinbarungen über den Haufen", heißt es darin. "Aber wir müssen ihnen klar signalisieren, dass wir reagieren können und werden."

Tatsächlich verlaufen die Bemühungen auf internationaler Ebene bislang in die gegenteilige Richtung: der Steuerwettbewerb soll gebremst und Steuerschlupflöcher geschlossen werden. Die Europäische Union versucht derzeit, die Besteuerung von Unternehmen anzugleichen. Die Grundlage für die Besteuerung soll vereinheitlicht werden. Später sollen sogar Gewinne und Verluste auf europäischer Ebene verteilt werden.

Theresa May droht mit Mini-Steuersätzen

Großbritannien war bisher schon dagegen und hat jetzt, da es die EU verlassen will, ohnehin ganz andere Pläne: Sollten die Austrittsverhandlungen negativ verlaufen, werde ihre Regierung "wettbewerbsfähige" Steuersätze einführen, drohte Premierministerin May unlängst, und "die weltbesten Unternehmen und größten Investoren" anlocken.

Gemeint sind damit Steuersätze von nur noch zehn statt bisher 20 Prozent. Auch US-Präsident Trump hatte im Wahlkampf eine "Steuerrevolution" mit Sätzen von 15 Prozent verkündet. In Deutschland werden Firmengewinne bisher mit knapp 30 Prozent besteuert.

CDU-Strategen sehen Handlungsdruck

Die Beamten von Bundesfinanzminister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) denken deshalb bereits über eine Unternehmensteuerreform nach. Auch CDU-Finanzpolitiker halten sie für "ein wichtiges Projekt", schon allein wegen der EU-Pläne. Die Strategen des CDU-Wirtschaftsrats meinen aber, so lange dürfe man im Ernstfall nicht warten.

Sollten Washington oder London die Steuern senken, dürfe man nicht lange auf das Ergebnis einer Steuerreform warten, dann müsse man "zügiger mit einer Senkung der Körperschaftsteuer und der Einkommensteuer für Personenunternehmen reagieren", schreiben sie in dem Positionspapier.

Festhalten an bisheriger Haushaltspolitik

Angesichts der in den nächsten fünf Jahren zu erwartenden Steuereinnahmen von etwa 130 Milliarden Euro gebe es "einen erheblichen Spielraum für Bürger wie für Unternehmen". Haushaltsüberschüsse dürften nicht für "ein Strohfeuer zusätzlicher Wohltaten" verbrannt werden. Die bisherige Haushaltspolitik Schäubles müsse beibehalten werden. L'essor des voitures électriques pourrait prendre au dépourvu les compagnies pétrolières, qui ont jusqu'à présent sous-estimé ce marché mondial, susceptible d'entraîner une baisse de la demande de brut dans la prochaine décennie, avertissent des experts dans un rapport. La baisse du coût des véhicules électriques et des énergies renouvelables pourrait donner un coût d'arrêt dès 2020 à la hausse de la demande de pétrole, estiment-ils.

L'essor du marché des véhicules électriques pourrait conduire à une baisse de la demande de deux millions de barils par jour (mbj) d'ici à 2025, ont-ils calculé. Une baisse similaire avait précédé l'effondrement des prix du pétrole en 2014.

Complémentarité plutôt que remplacement



D'ici à 2035, ce chiffre pourrait être multiplié par cinq, avec des véhicules électriques représentant un tiers du marché des transports routiers, selon ce rapport réalisé conjointement par l'ONG Carbon Tracker et le Grantham Institute, tous deux basés à Londres. Les secteurs de l'électricité et des transports routiers représentent environ la moitié de la consommation de combustibles fossiles.

« Les véhicules électriques et l'énergie solaire sont des éléments capables de changer la donne que l'industrie des combustibles fossiles a toujours sous-estimés », relève Luke Sussams, analyste pour Carbon Tracker. « Très peu d'entreprises ou d'institutions de l'industrie énergétique se penchent vraiment sur le bouleversement que provoquerait un développement exponentiel de ces technologies », a-t-il déclaré à l'AFP. Mais ce genre de raisonnement repose toujours sur un affrontement des deux énergies, alors qu'elles sont complémentaires et se substitueront lentement, selon le principe des vases communicants. Et cela prendra du temps.



Divergences de vues



Ainsi, le géant du pétrole et du gaz BP ne partage pas ce pronostic de Sussams. Il a estimé la semaine dernière que la demande de pétrole pour les voitures allait continuer à augmenter au moins jusqu'au milieu des années 2030. Selon lui, en 2035, les véhicules électriques ne représenteront que 6 % du marché.

Sur un stand, la voiture électrique en Chine est amusante mais quel sera son recyclage en fin de vie? © DR





Les experts indépendants sont divisés sur la vitesse à laquelle les véhicules électriques vont remplacer les véhicules fonctionnant avec des moteurs à combustion interne. Et c'est toute la question, car, jusqu'à présent, ils se sont largement trompés dans leurs pronostics, l'industrie automobile également avec Carlos Ghosn et Renault-Nissan en tête, partis à la conquête de cette nouvelle énergie 5 à 10 ans trop tôt.

Les technologies n'existaient pas toutes, les réseaux de recharge encore moins et la clientèle militante supposée « essuyer les plâtres » s'est montrée extrêmement rare. Sans parler du recyclage en fin de vie de ces millions de batteries, propres lorsqu'elles sont neuves, mais terriblement encombrantes lorsqu'il faut les mettre au rebut. On trouve là l'un des paradoxes des Verts qui encensent l'électrique lorsqu'il roule, mais ne voient pas ce qu'il en advient en fin de vie.

Fin des aides à l'achat



Selon l'Agence internationale de l'énergie, les véhicules électriques devraient représenter 8 % du marché d'ici à 2040 et entraîner une baisse de la demande de pétrole d'1,3 mbj seulement. Mais pour l'organisme de prévision privé Bloomberg New Energy Finance, selon des critères forcément très différents, ils devraient représenter 22 % du marché d'ici à 2035, une estimation cohérente avec celle de l'étude de Carbon Tracker.

« Nous supposons que les véhicules électriques seront moins chers » que ceux nécessitant du pétrole « à partir de 2020 », explique Luke Sussams, dont on pressent qu'il maintient les aides somptuaires à l'achat des gouvernements. Une erreur pourtant, Ségolène Royal a ainsi averti que la voiture électrique, dont la croissance des ventes ne motivera plus une aide à l'achat (6 400 euros actuellement + 3 600 euros en cas de reprise d'un vieux diesel), devra se vendre au vrai prix avant deux ans. Et cela changera la donne et cassera l'essor frissonnant du marché de l'électrique.

Siphonnage du réseau



La Chine n'est pas le monde et achète toujours beaucoup plus de voitures thermiques qu'électriques © X03234 / REUTERS





Le modèle de prévision de Carbon Tracker suppose aussi une croissance très rapide et l'absence de goulets d'étranglement comme une pénurie de bornes de recharge. Mais c'est faire abstraction, si ce schéma aboutit, du siphonnage du réseau par des milliers de voitures électriques branchées alors que, lors d'épisodes de grands froids, les pouvoirs publics demandent déjà aux Français de reporter une lessive ou un lave-vaisselle.

Dans une situation critique comme celle de cet hiver, les voitures branchées serviraient, selon un mode « bi-pass », à réalimenter le réseau, mais si elles sont branchées, c'est qu'elles sont déjà vides.



C'est un fait, à l'échelle planétaire en Chine, le plus grand marché de véhicules électriques au monde, plus d'un demi-million de véhicules électriques ont été vendus en 2016. « C'est presque une croissance exponentielle », souligne M. Sussams. Mais cela ne suffit pas à prolonger les courbes comme si le succès de l'électrique était définitivement acquis. D'autant plus que l'électricité en Chine est largement produite à partir de charbon hyperpolluant, ce qui ne fait que déplacer géographiquement le problème.



Les prévisions de Carbon Tracker et du Grantham Institute sont donc à prendre avec la plus grande circonspection, même si elles se rapprochent de celles de fabricants automobiles... comme Tesla ou GM, gros acteur de l'automobile en Chine. Feb 2 Visa Inc

Ministers have taken too long to consolidate the “alphabet soup” of agencies tasked with safeguarding the UK from cyber-attacks and there appears to be no coordination across the public sector, the public accounts committee (PAC) said.

The warning comes as concerns grow over Russian cyber-attacks. Moscow is denying alleged interference in the US presidential election in Donald Trump’s favour.

PAC said that despite cyber-attacks being ranked as a top four risk to UK national security since 2010, the role of the Cabinet Office, which is responsible for coordinating information protection across government, remains unclear.

Nato must do more to counter Russia's cyber-weaponry, says Fallon Read more

Meg Hillier, the committee chair, said: “Government has a vital role to play in cyber security across society but it needs to raise its game. Its approach to handling personal data breaches has been chaotic and does not inspire confidence in its ability to take swift, coordinated and effective action in the face of higher threat attacks.

“The threat of cybercrime is ever-growing, yet evidence shows Britain ranks below Brazil, South Africa and China in keeping phones and laptops secure. In this context it should concern us all that the government is struggling to ensure its security profession has the skills it needs.”

The report said the Cabinet Office’s ability to make informed decisions about security is “undermined by inconsistent and chaotic processes for recording personal data breaches”.

Reporting across Whitehall departments varies widely, with some highlighting thousands of data breaches while others recorded none at all.

The Cabinet Office does not collect or analyse departments’ performance in protecting information on a routine or timely basis and was not aware of the variability in reporting until the National Audit Office highlighted the issue last year, the MPs said.

“Without a consistent approach across Whitehall to identifying, recording and reporting security incidents, the Cabinet Office is unable to make informed decisions about where to direct and prioritise its attention,” the committee said.

The government is also struggling to ensure its security profession is suitably skilled, with the Cabinet Office unwilling to bring in a minimum standard for departments. “It remains unclear as to what skills gaps exist and how to fill these in the face of UK-wide skills shortages in this field,” the report said.

MPs said new initiatives to share information securely and classify information consistently across government are failing to deliver as planned.

The government ignored its own advice by failing to carry out a business case for government security classifications system, which was meant to deliver £110- to £150m-a-year in benefits, MPs said.

A National Cyber Security Centre spokesman said: “The government has been clear that the newly formed NCSC is the UK’s definitive authority on cyber security. In the four months since becoming operational, the NCSC has transformed how the UK deals with cyber security by offering incident management capabilities, fostering technical innovation to help prevent attacks and providing real-time cyber threat information to 3,000 organisations from over 20 different industries.

“The UK faces a growing threat of cyber-attacks and we share the committee’s determination to make the UK as safe a place as possible to live and do business online.”   Report briefly presents an overview of green glass along its scope and market segmentation with comprehensive study of the various aspects that are influencing the market positively and negatively.Report also segments the market into several major regions such as Europe, North America, Japan, China, India and Southeast Asia.

According to the report, representatives of Perak Tourism, including its acting chief executive officer Zuraida Md Taib, met recently with Macau Media Group representatives in the Malaysian city of Ipoh to discuss the promotion of tourism in both Macau and Ipoh, with the aim of cementing a mutual friendship.

In pursuit of these interests, the Macau Media Group delegation spent four days in Perak during the Chinese New Year, collecting footage and pictures for the promotion of Ipoh in Macau and mainland China.

It was also reported that the Macau group’s director Ke Jiangang met with state Tourism, Arts and Culture committee chairman Datuk Nolee Ashilin Mohd Radzi, in the same meeting, to discuss further collaboration between both cities.

“The group is on a mission to promote tourism in cities included in China’s belt-road and Ipoh is their first stop, especially since we have been chosen as Lonely Planet’s top 10 places to visit in Asia,” said Ashilin, adding that the partnership would also attract investment from Macau.

“We are also considering to recognize them [Macau] as our Chinese twin city, but this is still a work in progress [which is] dependant from the decision of Mentri Besar and stakeholders,” she told reporters after the meeting in the state secretariat on Tuesday.

According to Ashilin, “several business groups will come to Ipoh to look into the possibility of building five-star hotels and how to help the state government boost connectivity.” She further remarked that “if the partnership was smooth-sailing, the state would surely look forward to collaborating with more Chinese cities like Hong Kong, Shenzhen, and Guangzhou.”

She also addressed the possibility of direct flights between Macau and Ipoh.

“Hopefully this will entice their [Malaysia Airlines Bhd] counterpart in Macau to bring in direct flights soon,” she said.

Ipoh is the capital city of Perak state and is Malaysia’s third largest city, with a population of over 710,000 people. The city center is characterized by colonial era Chinese shop houses and several impressive historical buildings from the British Colonial era, such as the railway station. The city also has some modern attractions, such as the Lost World Of Tambun, which is the only theme park in Southeast Asia with natural hot springs coupled with an array of attractions and rides. RM When Donald Trump was running for president he vowed to boost the U.S. oil and gas industry, much of it found right here in Texas. Now that he’s in office, some of his policies seem aimed at doing just that. But others are having the opposite effect.

Just ask Subhi Khudairi, a partner at the Khudairi Group. The family business has offices in Houston but contracts with oil companies in Iraq. Khudairi was in the Iraqi city of Basra on business when he heard about the Trump administration’s travel ban on people from some Muslim-majority countries.

KUT's Mose Buchele reports

One of the employees Khudairi was traveling with is an Iraqi man with a U.S. green card and wife and family in the states. That meant they had to take their minds away from business to figure out the employee’s travel situation.

“He’s just cutting his trip short to get back to the U.S.,” Khudairi said. “We feel like we don’t know what’s going to happen day after day, so we’re just trying to get him home sooner rather than later in case another curveball is thrown at us.”

What worries Khudairi even more than the business disruption is the ill will the ban could generate in Iraq.

“Whether it’s long-term rights to oil concessions or investment opportunities – this may have a longer-term effect on those sorts of opportunities for American companies,” he said.

The oil and natural gas markets are global. So what happens globally with U.S. policy can be more important than what happens domestically. – Michael Maher, Baker Institute’s Center for Energy Studies at Rice University

Michael Maher, who worked at Exxon Mobil for 35 years before he became program adviser at the Baker Institute’s Center for Energy Studies at Rice University, agrees.

“The oil and natural gas markets are global,” he said. “So what happens globally with U.S. policy can be more important than what happens domestically.”

Maher said he thinks U.S. oil and gas companies are experiencing a kind of policy whiplash between Trump’s domestic and international agenda.

“If I looked at rules and regulations for the U.S., some of those are going to be positive for the industry,” he said, listing things like ending financial reporting requirements, approving the Keystone XL pipeline and rolling back environmental regulations.

But Trump’s international agenda – which includes the travel ban, the “ongoing war of words with Mexico,” and the specter of tariffs and trade wars – is deeply troubling.

“There's this idea that we’re going to be more friends with Russia,” he said, “but from an oil and gas future standpoint they’re not as critical to the world as China, because of the pull on demand that China has.”

While some fear business opportunities might dry up overseas, others worry that talent could disappear at home.

Jon Olson, chairman of UT Austin’s Petroleum and Geosystems Engineering Department, said there are a lot of talented students and faculty at UT from countries that are on Trump’s banned list.

“Basically were bringing the best and the brightest from all over the world to study here and then stay here," he said. "They increase the U.S. competitive edge by staying here. A lot of the technology that makes a business work is coming from a lot of international students.”

Back in Iraq, Subhi Khudairi said one final thing that worries him is what might come next.

“Is this the start of many more actions to come? Is this a slippery slope? Where does it end?" he said. "That’s a concern for many of us who are proud to be Americans but also originate from other countries.”

A concern that not only disrupts businesses, but also lives. Publicidade

O executivo-chefe da Uber, Travis Kalanick, deixou o conselho de empresários do presidente Donald Trump após ser pressionado devido ao decreto que proíbe temporariamente a entrada de cidadãos de sete países de maioria islâmica e de refugiados nos Estados Unidos.

Em e-mail para os funcionários da empresa nesta quinta-feira (2), Kalanick afirmou que conversou com o republicano sobre as preocupações com a política anti-imigração e os problemas que pode criar ao país.

Danish Siddiqui - 19.jan.2016/Reuters O executivo-chefe da Uber, Travis Kalanich, concede palestra em evento na Índia, em janeiro de 2016

Ele disse ter saído devido à interpretação que sua participação no grupo pode ter. "Integrar o grupo não era para ser um endosso ao presidente e a suas políticas, mas infelizmente isso tem sido mal interpretado", disse.

"Há muitas maneiras de continuar a defender pela mudança justa na imigração, mas ficar no conselho era uma forma de ficarmos no caminho para isso. O decreto está ferindo muitas pessoas em comunidades de todo o país."

A saída acontece após a Uber sofrer um boicote nos EUA por impedir o uso da tarifa dinâmica —que aumenta o preço das corridas— durante uma greve de taxistas em Nova York em protesto contra as medidas anti-imigração.

Manifestantes anti-Trump e usuários encararam a medida como uma forma de se aproveitar do ato para lucrar. Nos dias subsequentes, o aplicativo recebeu milhares de pedidos de cancelamento de americanos.

A demanda foi grande a ponto de a empresa ter que mudar o sistema de cancelamento para apagar os perfis de forma automática —antes um funcionário da Uber avaliava as solicitações e dava baixa nas assinaturas.

O presidente da Uber chegou a criticar o decreto, mas não estancou a perda de clientes. Também anunciou um fundo de US$ 3 milhões (R$ 9,36 milhões) para dar apoio aos motoristas que sejam prejudicados pela proibição.

As críticas chegaram também da própria equipe do aplicativo. Antes da carta a seus funcionários, Kalanick planejava ir à reunião do conselho econômico de Trump desta sexta (3) em Washington. Steve Piragis, owner of Piragis Northwoods Company in Ely, speaks against potential copper mining near the Boundary Waters at a rally outside the office of Rep. Rick Nolan in Duluth on Thursday.

More than 50 protesters rallied outside the Duluth office of U.S. Rep. Rick Nolan Thursday, condemning the Democratic congressman's letter earlier this week calling on the Trump administration to overturn a decision that called for a potential 20-year ban on mining on national forest land within the watershed of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness.

If the administration follows through on Nolan's request, it could rekindle the efforts of Twin Metals Minnesota to develop a massive underground copper-nickel mine near Ely and the southern edge of the Boundary Waters.

The project offers the tantalizing prospect of hundreds of good-paying jobs in a region of the state hard hit by a downturn in the iron mining industry recently. But opponents argue potential water pollution, and the creation of a mining district in the national forest, threatens Ely's tourism-based economy.

"Copper kills jobs," Steve Piragis, owner of Piragis Northwoods Company in Ely, told the crowd in Duluth. "In Ely, we have hundreds of people who are employed in the business of fresh water, clean water, that brings people to us."

• August: Ely calls a truce over mining as tourist economy booms

In December, the Department of the Interior under former President Obama put a two-year timeout on mineral development over 234,000 acres of Superior National Forest land that lies within the watershed of the Boundary Waters.

The government also called for a 20-year mineral withdrawal — essentially a moratorium on new mining projects — within the watershed and launched a two-year environmental study of that proposed moratorium.

"We need the study to go forward," said Becky Rom, national chair of the Campaign to Save the Boundary Waters. "The people need to know. Agencies need to know what the risk of sulfide ore mining is in the watershed. There is no technology known to man that removes that risk."

In a letter to the demonstrators, Nolan wrote that he supported responsible mining and a thorough environmental review process. But he argued an environmental review of mining in the watershed should wait until a specific mining plan is submitted.

That's the process that has played out for the proposed PolyMet copper-nickel mine, which is located about 20 miles south of Twin Metals, within a watershed that flows into Lake Superior, rather than the Boundary Waters.

"Denying any business activity before you know what it is — and what kind of pollution abatement technology they will use or how effective it will be — lacks common sense," Nolan wrote.

Nolan wrote that reviewing and potentially reversing the Obama administration's decisions is consistent with the Trump administration's order to freeze and review new government regulations.

But his letter was sharply criticized by 4th District Rep. Betty McCollum, whose district includes St. Paul. The fellow Democrat said the Obama administration's decision "was a victory for every Minnesotan who cares about preserving clean water, clean air, and pristine wild lands."

That split highlights a longstanding tension in the Democratic party that has been exacerbated by the debate over mining in recent years.

During Nolan's first stint in Congress in the 1970s, he was one of the original co-sponsors of legislation that expanded the Boundary Waters wilderness area, and banned the use of snowmobiles and motors in most lakes. He said he's received consistently high marks from environmental groups.

But he also represents a part of the state with a rich iron mining heritage and strong support for new mining proposals.

"This federal government action threatens our way of life and the jobs that come from this industry," said Frank Ongaro with Mining Minnesota. He said his industry group is asking the Trump administration to look at all possibilities to overturn the decisions.

Also at issue is the fate of Twin Metals' mineral leases in the Superior National Forest.

In December, the Obama administration refused to renew those leases, which the company has said are critical to its project. Nolan's letter does not mention the leases. But Twin Metals has sued the government over that decision. That lawsuit is still pending.

GREEN BAY - The discount movie theater in the East Town Mall will close after the credits roll on the last screening Feb. 9.

“It will be business as usual until then,” said Laine Kaplowitz, Landmark Theatres director of publicity. “If people have gift cards, they can still redeem them (through Feb. 9).”

Landmark Theatres, which operates the six-screen theater, declined to provide any further comment on why the movie theater abruptly decided to close other than to thank customers for years of patronage. The theater's website indicates Silver Cinemas, a subsidiary of Landmark, has operated the theater since 2001.

The Budget Cinemas - East Town, 2350 E. Mason St., is one of four Silver Cinemas locations operated by Los Angeles-based Landmark operates around the country. The other locations are in Madison, Denton, Texas, and Phoenix.

Budget Cinemas - East Town will close out its run on the city's east side by showing "Assassin's Creed," "Doctor Strange," "Storks" and "Trolls."

The space Budget Cinemas occupies was identified in a New Jersey group’s proposal to redevelop East Town Mall as a potential location for the Brown County Public Library's east-side branch. The group wants to convert the rest of the mall into a series of mid-sized spaces for national retailers and local uses.

Read or Share this story: http://gbpg.net/2k6q4uQ OTTAWA – Conservative leadership candidate Kevin O’Leary says he took down an Internet video of himself firing automatic weapons out of “respect” for the memorial to three of the six victims of the weekend massacre at a Quebec City mosque.

The video depicted O’Leary firing a variety of high-powered weapons — including machine guns and an assault rifle — during a visit to a Miami gun range. It was posted just as the high-profile funeral in Montreal was getting underway.

Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale described the timing of the video as “obviously crass, insensitive and exceedingly dumb.”

RELATED: Opinion: Why I wouldn’t vote for Kevin O’Leary—and neither should you

The post went up as several thousand mourners, including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, paid their respects to shooting victims Abdelkrim Hassane, Khaled Belkacemi and Aboubaker Thabti at a Montreal arena.

There were also prayers at the service for the three other victims — Azzeddine Soufiane, Mamadou Tanou Barry and Ibrahima Barry. Another funeral is scheduled to take place Friday in Quebec City.

The short clip, posted on the video sharing service Vimeo, showed O’Leary blazing away at paper targets with a number of firearms, including what looks like a heavy-calibre sniper rifle.

“Still got my marksman chops from my days as a military cadet at Stanstead College,” said the accompanying caption.

Several hours later, O’Leary tweeted, “Out of respect for today’s service, I have taken down my last post.”

The clip, however, remained visible on Vimeo throughout the afternoon.

O’Leary, a businessman and star of the U.S. reality-TV show “Shark Tank,” is widely considered to be the front-runner in the race to lead the federal Conservative party, despite his lack of political experience and faculty with French.

He bills himself as having the business savvy and negotiation skills to help turn around the economy, create jobs and deal with U.S. President Donald Trump.

O’Leary is scheduled to make his first public appearance alongside his leadership rivals at a debate Saturday night in Halifax. You're almost there.We've just sent a confirmation email to . Check it out to confirm your registration.

The latest New Zealand Manufacturers and Exporters Association (NZMEA) Survey of Business Conditions completed during January 2017, shows total sales in December 2016 increased 7.23% (year on year export sales increased by 10.01% with domestic sales increasing by 3.30%) on December 2015.

In the 3 months to December, export sales decreased an average of 1.4%, and domestic sales increased 11.7% on average.

The NZMEA survey sample this month covered NZ$275m in annualised sales, with an export content of 60%.

Net confidence rose to 10, up from 8 in November.

The current performance index (a combination of profitability and cash flow) is at 99.3, up from 98.3 last month, the change index (capacity utilisation, staff levels, orders and inventories) was at 101, with no change from the last survey, and the forecast index (investment, sales, profitability and staff) is at 104.5, up on the last result of 103.2. Anything over 100 indicates expansion.

Constraints reported were 78% markets and 22% skilled staff.

A net 45% of respondents reported a productivity increase in December.

Staff numbers decreased 7.9% year on year in December.

Supervisors, tradespersons, managers, professional/scientists and operators/labourers reported a moderate shortage.

“December’s manufacturing sales results showed a good bounce back from the results seen in October, September and July, particularly in export sales – manufacturers ended the year on a high note.” Said Dieter Adam.

“Export sales in December improved 10.01% on the same month in 2015, which was higher than the increase of 6.44% reported in November. These results translated into an average month decrease of -1.4% in the 3 months to December, which was still held down in the negative due to a poor month for exports in October.

“Domestic sales in December stayed positive with a 3.3% increase on December 2015. This was, however, a moderation on the exceptional growth felt in the previous three months. The average monthly growth of domestic sales in the 3 months to December remained high at 11.7%.

“We can now get a good picture on how the manufacturing sector fared in 2016. Domestic sales experienced an average monthly growth of 5.8% on the previous year’s months over the last 12 months, representing a positive trend of domestic sales. Export sales saw an average monthly growth of 2.1% in the same period. 2016 most definitely had its ups and downs for manufacturing sales, but overall, the trend showed solid growth for the year overall.

“The downward trend in export sales towards the end of the year was concerning – though the last two months of the year did turn this around somewhat. Weak export numbers have been reflected in the Statistics New Zealand numbers – in December, mechanical machinery and equipment exports fell 8.83% on December 2015, while electrical machinery and equipment fell 13.5%. This is a reminder that we need to renew focus on building high-value exports and push for growth in these areas. ” Said Dieter.

Feb. 3 (BusinessDesk) – Intueri Education Group will quit Australia by the end of the year after losing federal government subsidies and is considering bids for some of its assets, saying it was probably in breach of its banking covenants in 2016.Friday 03 February 2017 09:24 AM

Intueri to quit Australia after losing subsidies, says all assets may be up for sale

By Paul McBeth

Feb. 3 (BusinessDesk) – Intueri Education Group will quit Australia by the end of the year after losing federal government subsidies and is considering bids for some of its assets, saying it was probably in breach of its banking covenants in 2016.

The Auckland-based private education provider is undertaking a strategic review of operations in both Australia and New Zealand and is considering approaches from “a number of interested parties”, it said in a statement.

Its Australian subsidiary, Conwal & Associates, won’t reapply for the Australian Department of Education and Training’s VET Fee-Help scheme to pay some or all of a student’s fees, and Intueri will quit Australia altogether by the end of the year, seeking a buyer for its business across the Tasman, which is forecast to break even.

Intueri sold its Dive School, subject to conditions, which is expected to settle next month, and said a New Zealand Tertiary Education Commission investigation into its Quantum unit, which also attracted a review by the Serious Fraud Office, will be reported on shortly. It reaffirmed its expectation that the company was in breach of its banking covenants and said it’s still working with its lender, ANZ Bank New Zealand.

“Whilst there are opportunities to build our business operations without access to government VET funding, Intueri’s current financial position does not allow us to put this medium term investment in place, and hence we are reviewing options to divest or close our Australian operations,” chairman Chris Kelly said. “We remain in close dialogue with our banking partner and expect to make significant progress assessing capital restructuring and strategic options over the next two to three months.”

The education provider raised about $60 million in an initial public offering in 2014 to fund the acquisition of the Quantum group and become the country’s biggest private training organisation, selling shares at $2.35 apiece and valuing the company at $252.5 million, but has slumped to just 3 cents, or $3 million.

Intueri was stitched together by ASX-listed Arowana International, which kept a 24.9 percent stake in the New Zealand company. The offer, which came in a year when the IPO pipeline was running hot, was managed by UBS New Zealand and Macquarie Securities (NZ).

However, the company’s bid to go public was beset with troubles from the get-go. It had to amend its prospectus after a student died at its diving school, and needed a waiver to let it list with just 330 retail shareholders rather than the minimum 500 normally required.

That offer document got a ticking off by the Financial Markets Authority which said the prospectus could have been clearer about how student enrollment figures were disclosed without taking more action, while the TEC restricted enrollments for unfunded students and the SFO sought information about the Quantum school.

Intueri said it expects the SFO will end its inquiry once the TEC report is released, with Quantum the “only outstanding regulatory matter for Intueri’s New Zealand operations”.

In its 2016 annual report, Arowana said it had been “dismayed and very disappointed at what has transpired with Intueri Education” and that its engagement after the IPO had been “very limited and more than arm’s length”.

Metro Glass warns annual profit may drop as expected NZ sales don’t eventuate

By Rebecca Howard

Feb. 3 (BusinessDesk) – Metro Performance Glass, which has more than half the country’s glass processing market, said annual net profit was likely to be similar or even lower than the prior year as local sales lagged behind expectations with dwindling work in Canterbury and a dip in Wellington.

The Auckland-based company said it expects net profit to be in a range of $19 million to $20.5 million in the year ending March 31 versus a profit of $20.5 million a year earlier. Revenue is expected to be $240 million-to-$245 million versus $188 million in the prior period. The guidance includes seven months of trading from Australian Glass Group with sales estimated to be in a range of $27 million to $29 million. Metro Glass bought AGG in August for A$43.1 million.

“Whilst Metro Glass’s sales in the year to date have grown considerably versus last year, sales have recently lagged behind the company’s expectations due to a fasterthanexpected slowdown in the Canterbury residential market and a shortterm drop in activity in Wellington following the November 2016 earthquake,” the company said in a release to the New Zealand stock exchange.

Metro Glass also noted that scaling up production and distribution capability in the North Island has added to operating costs in the short term. “Meanwhile, momentum in the commercial project market continues to fluctuate, with certain large projects in particular facing protracted installation timetables. This volatility has resulted in inefficiencies for Metro Glass in production planning and inventory and labour management,” it said.

In Australia, it said the integration of AGG with Metro Glass is on track and the business has been trading to its expectations.

Looking ahead, chairman John Goulter said the supportive construction market outlook will ensure revenue growth for several years but the company needs to focus further on automation, process and cost saving across manufacturing, logistics and glazing.

The shares, which listed at $1.70 on the NZX in 2014, last traded at $1.89.

INDIANAPOLIS – Out-of-state retailers who do business in Indiana will be required to collect a tax from their customers making online purchases from them.

Senate Bill 545 passed the Senate by a 42-1 vote, with only Sen. Jim Buck, R-Kokomo, dissenting. Specifically, the bill requires retail merchants outside of Indiana to pay the sales tax if their gross revenues exceeds $100,000 in a calendar year and they make more than 200 separate transactions within Indiana.

The bill’s author, Sen. Luke Kenley, R-Noblesville, said it will help level the competition between merchants located in Indiana and those selling goods online.

“We have brick and mortar retailers in the state who pays 7 percent Indiana sales tax,” Kenley said. “They employ people, they pay taxes, they grow our economy and we put them at a seven percent disadvantage to somebody who may be on the internet and doesn’t pay taxes.”

Kenley cited studies showing that Indiana loses up to $200 million a year in lost sales tax income from online purchases.

Kenley said tax systems are only strong when they are fair.

The current tax system requires citizens to pay use taxes on their out-of-state purchases when they file their Indiana tax returns. About $2 million was collected in 2013 through use taxes.

“This is all about fairness,” Kenley said. “It’s all about getting equity for our brick and mortar retailers. It’s all about getting us to have a reasonable sales tax system.”

Buck cited his previous experience as a retail owner for his decision to vote against the bill.

He said increases in taxes always benefit larger businesses and hinder small business owners. Buck said internet purchases have been the only way small stores can survive against retailers like Walmart.

“I just think it’s an undue burden on a small retailer,” Buck said.

The bill now moves to the House for further consideration.

INDIANAPOLIS — Indiana lawmakers are putting a bill on hold after courts ruled part of current vaping law unconstitutional.

The latest version of Senate Bill 1 would remove the strict security restrictions that essentially created a monopoly. Only one security firm, Lafayette-based Mulhaupt’s, could met the requirements. SB 1 also would get rid of a provision that barred new manufacturers from entering the industry after July 2016.

Lawmakers intended to hear the bill in committee Wednesday, but removed the bill from the agenda so attorneys could review it in light of the ruling.

“It’s not that it’s going anywhere. It’s still a priority, but we’re looking at it. Parts of the ruling we’d already dealt with in the bill,” Senate President Pro Tem David Long said.

The ruling from the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals found parts of the current vaping law unconstitutional. The decision in Legato Vapors LLC and Right to be Smoke-Free Coalition Inc. v. David Cook stated that Indiana’s highly specific restrictions on security, cleanliness and audit requirements inflicted on out-of-state manufacturers violated federal law.

When the law was written there were no federal regulations regarding vaping and e-liquids. Since then some regulations have been put into place and more will by 2018, according committee testimony from Tony Abboud, national legislator director of Vapor Technology Association.

Even with more federal regulations on the way, Long still wants Indiana to be involved with regulating the vaping business.

“It’s appropriate for Indiana to have its own rules and regulations for protection. The key of this thing is not to do it in a way that it’ll keep people out of the market and provides a monopoly for some people,” Long said.

Over the last couple years the legislators have learned more about the vaping industry and what it does, Senate Minority Leader Tim Lanane said.

“I think at no point in time was it ever our intentions to run anybody out of business. We’ve got to do whatever is necessary to make sure those small operators can conduct their business, but in a safe manner,” Lanane said.

Fixing the law is a priority in the House as well. House Speaker Brian Bosma, R-Indianapolis, said he wants to find a balance between consumer protections and preventing monopolies.

Long emphasized lawmakers are making sure they are not overreaching and following what the ruling said they cannot do.

It is unclear when the bill will return to committee for further examination.

Taylor Brown is a reporter TheStatehouseFile.com, a news website powered by Franklin College journalism students. The day after a scheduled appearance at UC Berkeley by right-wing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos erupted in violence and ended before it began, campus officials condemned the actions of agitators who invaded the campus and disrupted nearly 1,500 peaceful protesters. They also praised small groups of Berkeley students who organized themselves to begin cleaning up debris.

UCPD has launched an investigation of last night’s riotous actions, instigated by some 150 masked individuals with paramilitary tactics, including hurling Molotov cocktails, setting fires, throwing fireworks at police, pushing barricades into windows and damaging campus and city property.

“The violence was an attack on our fundamental values, which are maintaining and nurturing open inquiry and an inclusive, civil society — the bedrock of a genuinely democratic nation,” said Chancellor Nicholas Dirks. “We are now, and will remain in the future, completely committed to free speech not only as a vital component of our campus identity but as essential to our educational mission.”

He added, “We appreciate the efforts of our police and Student Affairs staff to protect the rights of both speaker and protesters and their commitment to public safety and minimizing injuries.” Dirks also issued a statement earlier today condemning the violence and defending free speech.

Sgt. Sabrina Reich, UCPD public information officer, said campus police made one arrest last night of a non-student, on charges of failure to disperse. Officers made several dispersal announcements to the crowd assembled outside the Martin Luther King Jr. Student Union, where Yiannopoulos had been invited speak at 8 p.m. by the Berkeley College Republicans.

This morning, two Berkeley College Republicans were attacked while conducting an interview in front of Sproul Hall by two men not affiliated with the campus. The men were arrested by UCPD, which is investigating the incident and did not yet have more details.

UCPD is compiling video from Wednesday’s violence and will be reviewing it to try to identify suspects, Reich added. She encouraged anyone with information or who may have been a victim to contact police at (510) 642-6760.

While police are aware that while some members of the crowd that had gathered outside the student union on Wednesday were hurt, Reich said, “no one has come forward and made a police report regarding being assaulted or injured.” UCPD rescued multiple individuals in the crowd who were being attacked, trapped or injured.

An early estimate of campus damage is around $100,000, according to campus officials. There are broken windows at the MLK Student Union, a generator that caught fire and was destroyed, concrete steps at the student union that need sand blasting, graffiti to clean up and some pavers and trees on Sproul Plaza that may need replacement. One particular tree on the plaza was badly singed by fire.

The city of Berkeley’s Downtown Business Association is reporting damage to more than 10 businesses including several banks, a Starbucks, a TargetExpress and Sprint and T-Mobile stores.

Already last night, an ad hoc group of UC Berkeley students who organized through social media and word of mouth decided to start picking up the broken pieces of their campus with brooms and paper bags, and they returned this morning around 5 a.m. to continue working.

Among them was William Morrow, president of the Associated Students of the University of California, who said the cleanup “was a real statement that the students of this campus care about this campus — about the buildings, the people, about maintaining a campus atmosphere that’s inviting to the rest of the world, so it can engage with it.”

“Last night was not reflective of that,” he continued. “What students were partaking in was a peaceful protest and anticipating a sharing of opinions and a dance party, but outside agitators infiltrated our community and didn’t treat it with the respect for our historic tradition of nonviolence.”

The campus also has received reports that Berkeley students took it upon themselves to try to protect Lower Sproul Plaza and privately owned shops on Bancroft Way from vandalism.

Before Jamcracker, Manish led the Office Automation Group at Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), an IT services, consulting and business solutions organization.

"Reltio's ground-breaking approach to managing data is refreshing," said Manish Jain. "I'm excited to become part of the team spearheading the new India office, and to play a role in expanding the company's presence in the Asia-Pacific market, thereby enabling more organizations to realize the platform's immense business value. Needless to say, we are hiring in all positions!"

The opening of this new office and appointment of Manish Jain follows other recent company moves.

Additionally, Reltio was certified as a great workplace by the independent analysts at Great Place to Work®, and recognized by Fortune magazine as one of the top 30 workplaces in technology.

2016 was a record-breaking year for Reltio – less than a year after Reltio officially launched – it was named a leader in the The Forrester Wave™: Master Data Management, Q1 2016. Technology analyst firm, IDC, named Reltio as one of five top innovators in the platform as a service (PaaS) market. Reltio added leading companies in high tech, retail, media & entertainment and insurance as customers; including a major car retailer, a large fast food franchiser, one of the world's largest specialist insurers and a global media investment group.

Travis Kalanick, donald trump

San Francisco/Washington, (ANTARA News) - Pemimpin perusahaan Uber Technologies Inc, Travis Kalanick, mengundurkan diri dari kelompok penasihat bisnis Presiden Amerika Serikat Donald Trump, kata Kalanick dalam surel perusahaan yang dibaca Reuters, Kamis.CEO perusahaan aplikasi itu belakangan ini mendapatkan tekanan berat dari para pegiat, termasuk supir-supir Uber sendiri, yang menentang kebijakan imigrasi pemerintahan Trump. Banyak di antara supir Uber merupakan warga imigran."Bergabung dengan kelompok tersebut (tim penasihat Trump) tidak berarti (saya) mendukung presiden (Trump) ataupun agendanya tapi, sayangnya, (banyak) orang mengira seperti itu (Kalanick mendukung Trump dan agendanya, red)," kata Kalanick melalui surat elektronik.Kalanick sebelumnya berencana menghadiri pertemuan kelompok penasihat bisnis tersebut pada Jumat.Ia mengatakan dirinya telah berbicara singkat dengan Trump soal perintah keimigrasian "dan masalah-masalah yang ditimbulkan terhadap masyarakat kita". Ia mengatakan kepada Trump bahwa dirinya tidak akan bergabung dengan dewan ekonomi.Kalanick semakin mengalami tekanan untuk meninggalkan dewan tersebut setelah Trump mengeluarkan perintah eksekutif, yang untuk sementara melarang warga dari tujuh negara berpenduduk mayoritas Muslim masuk ke Amerika Serikat."Perintah eksekutif itu menyakitkan banyak anggota masyarakat di seluruh Amerika," tulisnya dalam pesan kepada para karyawan."Keluarga-keluarga terpisah, orang-orang tertahan di luar negeri dan ada ketakutan yang semakin dalam bahwa AS tidak lagi menjadi tempat yang ramah bagi para imigran."Pengunduran diri Kalanick itu kemungkinan akan memberikan tekanan serupa kepada para pemimpin perusahaan, yang dijadwalkan hadir dalam pertemuan dengan Trump pada Jumat.General Motors Co mengatakan pemimpinnya akan datang sementara Walt Disney Co pada Kamis telah mengatakan bahwa pemimpin mereka tidak akan datang karena akan menghadiri pertemuan dewan direktur, yang sebelumnya sudah lama direncanakan.Gedung Putih belum memberikan komentar soal perkembangan terakhir itu.(Uu.T008)

Editor: Unggul Tri Ratomo A 2017 Jaguar SUV stolen from a Naperville car dealership lot as employees watched last week was recovered after a 16-year-old boy crashed the vehicle in Chicago, Naperville police said.

In a case almost identical to one in which two Infiniti luxury cars were stolen from another Naperville dealership, an unknown person walked into the 1559 W. Ogden Ave. Jaguar retailer on Jan. 27, climbed behind the wheel of a black Jaguar F PACE model and drove away before workers realized the SUV was being stolen, Cmdr. Lou Cammiso said.

It's not known if the teen, arrested by Chicago police Jan. 28 and charged with possession of a stolen vehicle, is the same person who drove the SUV off the lot, Cammiso said.

The arrest was made four days after three men walked into Infiniti of Naperville, 1550 W. Ogden Ave., got into two QX60s that employees had just washed and drove off, police said. Workers did not immediately realize what was happening until after the cars were gone, police said.

On the same day, Jan. 24, four vehicles were stolen from the Jaguar dealership by burglars who broke in through a service department overhead door after the business had closed. The stolen 2016 Jaguar, Land Rover and Ford Fusion have not been recovered, but a second Land Rover was found abandoned near Rickert Drive and Book Road, police said.

Cammiso said similar crimes have been occurring throughout the Chicago area, but are not believed to be the work of a single group.

"It appears to be mostly people with the same idea," he said. "There isn't any kind of organized group that's responsible, that I know of."

wbird@tribpub.com Did Christina El Moussa already flip the flop of her breakup? After separating from Tarek El Moussa, her husband of seven years, the HGTV star has reportedly started dating Gary Anderson. Get to know more about Gary and what led to this possible new romance.

1. Gary worked with Christina and Tarek before their split.

Talk about mixing business and pleasure. Shortly after Christina El Moussa, 33, and Tarek El Moussa, 34, announced they were splitting to “reevaluate” their marriage and professional life, there was talk that she was already seeing someone! That person in question is allegedly Gary Anderson, a contractor who did work for Tarek and Christina while the Flip Or Flop couple was still together, according to TMZ.

2. He may also be a real estate agent.

Along with the news that Christina and Gary are dating, TMZ included a picture of one Gary Anderson from First Team, a real estate agency. Mr. Anderson is listed as working in Yorba Linda, California.

UPDATE: Gary has reportedly been divorced twice! Details can be found right here.

3. He reportedly witnessed the event that split up the El Moussas.

When Christina and Tarek announced their breakup on Dec. 12, it shocked Flip Or Flop fans everywhere. Yet, they had been secretly estranged since a May 2016 incident that required a visit from the authorities! California deputies went to the El Moussa home after reportedly receiving a call about a “suicidal” man with a gun. When they arrived, a witness claimed they saw Tarek take a gun with him before going up a hiking trail behind the home.

That witness was reportedly Gary, who was at a neighbor’s house the day of the alleged incident. He went over and comforted the crying and shaking Christina, who supposedly told him about Tarek and the gun. (Later, they clarified that Tarek took it for protection from “mountain lions and rattlesnakes.”)

4. He’s not a Becky With The Good Hair.

Christina and Tarek haven’t been together since May 23, according to PEOPLE magazine. Still, it’s not like she and Gary were fooling around behind Tarek’s back. Christina and Gary didn’t begin this romantic relationship until “months after the incident.”

5. Tarek won’t be jealous of Gary.

“We have both dated other people following the separation,” Christina and Tarek said in the statement that confirmed their split. While they work out how to co-parent their two children (Taylor, 6, and Brayden, 1) while running their business, it seems the last thing Christina and Tarek are concerned with is whom the other is dating.

Are you still in shock over Christina and Tarek’s breakup, HollywoodLifers?

Enlarge this image toggle caption MONEY SHARMA/AFP/Getty Images MONEY SHARMA/AFP/Getty Images

The CEO of Uber, Travis Kalanick, has resigned from President Trump's economic council made up of U.S. business leaders. His resignation comes after a consumer campaign to boycott the ride hailing company because of Kalanick's association with the Trump administration.

In an email to staff, obtained by NPR, Kalanick said, "Joining the group was not meant to be an endorsement of the President or his agenda but unfortunately it has been misinterpreted to be exactly that."

Since Trump's executive order banning immigrants from seven majority-Muslim countries came down last week it has sparked widespread protests. Many Uber customers were outraged when Uber lowered its prices while taxi drivers were on strike at New York City's JFK airport over the order. The price drop was perceived as a move to take advantage of the strike and draw business away from the taxis. Uber denies this was the case. But, it helped fuel a Dump Uber campaign.

In Kalanick's email to employees the CEO pointedly rejected any ban on immigrants or refugees. He wrote: "The executive order is hurting many people in communities all across America. ... Immigration and openness to refugees is an important part of our country's success and quite honestly to Uber's."

Trump's council is made up of some of the wealthiest chief executives in the country — among them: Mary T. Barra of General Motors, Robert A. Iger of Disney and Virginia M. Rometty of IBM.  (Québec) Il y a un an, le géant américain Lowe's annonçait l'achat de RONA dans une transaction de 3,2 milliards $. Du coup, le Groupe BMR devenait le plus gros quincaillier de propriété québécoise dans le domaine de la rénovation. Et l'entreprise qui fête ses 50 ans a aujourd'hui faim, même très faim. Elle vise à augmenter ses parts de marchés à travers la province et même conquérir l'Ontario.

En 2016, la vente de l'un des plus importants fleurons québécois avait fait couler beaucoup d'encre. Plusieurs ont reproché au gouvernement son inaction devant la transaction qui a été officialisée au mois de mai.

Depuis, des enseignes de Lowe's (NYSE : LOW) ont commencé à pousser à la place de celle de RONA, notamment à Boucherville, près du siège social. Pour 2017, la société américaine envisage la plus importante croissance qu'a connue RONA au cours des cinq dernières années. Quatre magasins de proximités vont ouvrir, neuf succursales vont être rénovées, de nouvelles technologies seront développées et la vente d'appareils électroménagers sera intégrée dans 47 points de vente.

Dans ses cartons, l'entreprise a également comme objectif que 40 magasins à grande surface RONA, dont 17 dans la province, passent sous la bannière Lowe's d'ici quatre ans. Aucun plan n'est sur la table pour les Réno-Dépôt.

Cette stratégie d'affaires n'intimide en rien le Groupe BMR, qui a vu le jour à Montréal grâce au partenariat entre six marchands qui souhaitaient obtenir de meilleurs prix pour l'achat de matériaux. Cette entreprise a également l'intention d'appuyer sur le champignon et prendre de l'expansion. Actuellement, la Coop fédérée, propriétaire du groupe, exploite 325 magasins BMR, dont une soixantaine sous la bannière Unimat, au Québec, en Ontario et dans les provinces maritimes. De ce nombre, 18 se trouvent dans la Capitale-Nationale et sept en Ontario.

«On prévoit une importante croissance en Ontario pour les prochaines années [...] On vise être aussi présent qu'au Québec. On n'exclut rien comme stratégie, ça peut être par acquisition ou par développement de nouveaux magasins», confie au Soleil Pascal Houle, chef de la direction du Groupe BMR, qui ne ferme pas non plus la porte à la possibilité de faire d'autres petits vers l'Ouest canadien. «Notre vision à long terme est de devenir un leader canadien», poursuit-il, assurant du même souffle que la compagnie veut continuer de consolider sa présence à travers la province.

«Nous sommes très présents en région, mais il y a encore de la place. Pour les villes de Montréal et de Québec, nous avons comme plan d'être plus présents d'ici les deux prochaines années. On veut demeurer le leader dans le domaine des quincailleries et des matériaux de construction», souhaite le patron. En 2016, ce sont 11 magasins que le Groupe BMR a ouverts au Québec. Au moins une dizaine d'ouvertures sont prévues pour 2017.

Nouveaux points de vente à Québec

Bien qu'il refuse de donner un chiffre précis pour la région de Québec, M. Houle confie que plusieurs nouveaux points de vente devraient ouvrir leurs portes au cours des deux prochaines années. Un nouveau concept de magasin est d'ailleurs actuellement à l'étude. Pour l'heure, le Groupe BMR compte quatre types de bannières, soit les BMR Express (de 3000 à 4000 pi²), BMR (de 8000 à 10 000 pi²), BMR Expert (8000 pi²) et BMR Extra (plus de 25 000 pi²). Pour l'ouverture d'un magasin d'une superficie standard, la facture oscille entre 6 et 10 millions $.

Tout en poursuivant son plan d'expansion, la compagnie entend miser sur les produits québécois. Actuellement, l'entreprise, qui a enregistré un chiffre d'affaires de 1,7 milliard $ en 2016, compte un total de 1700 fournisseurs, dont près de 1000 sont Québécois. Ces derniers représentent 74 % du volume d'achat du Groupe BMR.

Quant à l'impact suivant la vente de RONA, M. Houle souligne qu'il est «minime», bien qu'il concède que son entreprise ait connu «une importante croissance de ses ventes». Il attribue les bons résultats principalement à la stratégie d'affaires et à la fusion du Groupe BMR et Unimat en 2015. Ensemble, l'entreprise compte aujourd'hui 8000 travailleurs.

«C'est trop tôt pour voir un impact. Nous avons toujours favorisé les fournisseurs québécois et c'est ce que nous allons faire dans le futur. Nous n'avons pas vraiment vu de changement. Nous sommes un fleuron et nous espérons que les consommateurs vont continuer d'encourager les entreprises québécoises. Nos compétiteurs sont des multinationales, des joueurs nord-américains, on se doit d'être meilleur et de continuer d'innover», dit-il, précisant que le groupe a investi d'importants montants pour entreprendre un virage numérique. Un nouveau site sera lancé au printemps prochain et différentes technologies seront mises à la disposition des consommateurs.

Ford isn’t just a car company anymore. As a part of its effort to build a portfolio of products that empower smarter cities, the car-maker has opened its first FordHub in New York — a space that showcases its emphasis on being a “mobility” company as well as an automotive company.

“Business is moving from the traditional automotive to automotive and mobility, and we wanted to build a brand experience studio where we can connect with consumers and consumers who don’t own cars,” Andrew Birkic, global advanced consumer experience platforms manager, told Digital Trends. “As we migrate to a different business model — obviously we’re still with the core business — but it’s an opportunity to showcase our other products and so this is our first studio doing it.”

More: Crowdfunded ebike provides an affordable way to go green in India

Located in the Oculus, the transportation hub near the World Trade Center in New York City, the FordHub offers a glimpse at the possibilities of a smarter city thanks to a union between technology and transportation.

For example, as you walk in it’s impossible to miss a large screen that displays commute information — such as departure times for trains at the Fulton Station, the Staten Island ferry, the PATH and the LIRR, as well as how many CITI bikes are left at a nearby docking station. All of this information is available via a plethora of online services and apps, but Ford’s display puts it all together in real-time.

In front of the display is another touch-interface that lets you choose a location, such as Chelsea Market. Tapping it pulls up a path from the FordHub to Chelsea Market on the larger, mounted display that also offers brief information about the history of the market.

In the middle of the space is a large racetrack-like model, where golf-sized balls rolled through. Birkic said it is meant to symbolize the many different layers of city transportation, from highways to the subway, as well as the flow of moving from one to the other.

Many of the things you can do at the FordHub are interactive. For example, you can also customize a Ford car via a tablet, and if you’re interested in the result, employees will put you in contact with local dealerships. There’s a virtual reality station that has you building a Mustang on top of the Empire State building with the HTC Vive; and you can also move through a city while playing an interactive game — a tool meant to demonstrate the things you could do during when you’re in a self-driving car.

One of the cooler installations is all the way at the back, and it involves approximately 5,412 model cars. Each are outfitted with an LED, and Birkic says the bottom of the installation features Lidar sensors — the same technology used by self-driving cars to detect obstacles on the road. Thanks to Lidar, the installation senses movement and changes the color of the cars to create various patterns.

Visitors can get a Ford Hub Card at the Hub, which is used to activate some interactions like the Lidar selfie installation — the code on the card can be used to find their “saved experiences” online.

It seems as though the FordHub will be open indefinitely, unlike Google’s recent pop-up that lasted three months. The next FordHub slated to launch is in San Francisco. La photo nous laisse voir un employé de Fiready qui s’affaire au chargement de la cargaison de bois de chauffage séché et ensaché qui a été livrée dans la Péninsule acadienne, jeudi. - Gracieuseté

Deux entreprises du Nord-Ouest ont uni leurs efforts afin de faire un geste de solidarité envers les sinistrés de la crise du verglas dans la Péninsule acadienne.

Grâce à Fiready Inc., de Clair, et Rossignol Transport, d’Edmundston, l’équivalent de 13 cordes de bois de chauffage ensaché a été livré dans la région de Lamèque, jeudi.

La copropriétaire de Fiready Inc, Marielle Clair, a rappelé que l’idée de confectionner ce produit par son entreprise découle justement de la crise du verglas de 1998 au Québec.

À ce moment, l’entreprise familiale James T. Clair Ltd a acheminé plusieurs cargaisons de bois séché dans les Cantons de l’Est, au Québec, et dans l’est des États-Unis.

«C’est justement à partir de cette crise du verglas que nous avons décidé d’approfondir le concept et de créer un produit de bois de foyer à valeur ajoutée, séché au four et ensaché», a-t-elle raconté.

En constatant la crise qui sévit actuellement dans la Péninsule acadienne, la compagnie a décidé d’apporter sa contribution. Fiready a fourni l’équivalent de 13 cordes de bois de chauffage qui ont été livrées par la compagnie Rossignol Transport, jeudi.

Une fois sur place, des responsables des Travaux publics à Lamèque se sont chargés de la distribution.

Du Restigouche à la Péninsule

Les efforts du Restigouche pour aider les sinistrés du verglas se sont poursuivis mardi alors que plusieurs voyages de dons de toutes sortes ont pris la route de la Péninsule acadienne.

Parmi ceux-ci, deux camions remplis de bois, un en provenance du Groupe Savoie (bûches énergétiques) de Saint-Quentin et un autre improvisé par les citoyens de Kedgwick dans le cadre de l’Opération Coeur de Lion (don d’un citoyen). Pour ce dernier, une véritable corvée communautaire a été organisée afin de couper et de charger le bois.

SÃO PAULO — Apesar de paulistana, a astrônoma Duília de Mello cresceu no Rio e lembra com orgulho dos tempos da faculdade de astronomia na Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro: “A melhor do Brasil”, define. A astrônoma que atua em projetos na Nasa, no entanto, se preocupa com a falta de investimentos em ciência, área que a levou, ainda em 1995, a seguir carreira no exterior.

— É uma crise que o Brasil está passando. Já está acontecendo a evasão dos gênios. Acontece todo dia a fuga de cérebros, como a gente chama. Eu fico preocupada porque o Brasil precisa de investimento em ciência, tecnologia e inovação — disse.

Duília de Mello foi uma das palestrantes do terceiro dia da Campus Party, festival que ocorre desde terça-feira no Pavilhão de Exposições do Anhembi, em São Paulo. A astrônoma é uma das cientistas que atuam com o telescópio Hubble desde 1998 e uma das responsáveis pela descoberta das bolhas azuis, aglomerados de estrelas formados fora de galáxias. Duília também descobriu a supernova SN 1997D. Durante a palestra, a astrônoma contou bastidores da atuação no Hubble e como as imagens do telescópio são geradas.

O sucesso no exterior ocorreu graças a um corte de gastos no investimento em pesquisa, ainda em 1995. A astrônoma decidiu deixar o Brasil após receber uma carta do Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico (CNPq) avisando que os investimentos para recém-doutores diminuiria em 50%.

— Eu investi a minha vida fazendo doutorado e não via uma sociedade que valorizava isso. Isso é uma pena porque o Brasil é um país que precisa de cientistas — afirmou.

MULHERES NA CIÊNCIA

A palestra de Duília de Mello ocorreu em um dia em que outras mulheres também foram destaques na Campus Party. O feminismo e a atuação das mulheres nas áreas de ciência e tecnologia foram temas de outras palestras durante o terceiro dia. Segundo informações da organização do evento, a porcentagem de mulheres, que no primeiro ano era de 3%, hoje está em 36%.

Apesar do avanço, a situação ainda não é ideal. Sócia da Infopreta, empresa de tecnologia e inovação que contrata apenas mulheres negras, Buh D’Angelo, de 22 anos, acredita que não existe reconhecimento técnico.

— Se houvesse, eu estaria na mesa de robótica, computação. A gente faz o papel de ativista — disse Buh, que deu palestra esta quinta-feira e é especializada em eletrônica, automação industrial e robótica. — A primeira vez que eu vim aqui, fiquei na porta. As pessoas têm que observar isso.

Para Duília, a participação de mulheres no setor tecnológico ainda é um problema.

— Não é que a menina deva fazer ciência porque é legal, mas porque ela gosta, porque ela é competente, porque ela quer fazer — disse.

Segundo a astrônoma, o ideal é que sejam apresentados exemplos para as meninas, ainda na infância, se sentirem inspiradas.

— A mulher deve mostrar para a menina o que ela pode alcançar, porque, se ela não vê um exemplo, ela se intimida. Você tem que ver as mulheres bem-sucedidas para ver que você pode ser também — afirmou.

(* Estagiário, com supervisão de Flávio Freire) The rocketship of cloud growth continued at the end of 2016 for Amazon Web Services.

The public cloud provider announced Thursday that it brought in a little more than US$3.5 billion during the fourth quarter of last year, up 47 percent from the same period in 2015.

Quarterly operating income rose 60 percent to $926 million, compared to $580 million during the prior year quarter.

That's nothing to sneeze at, but AWS's revenue growth was the lowest it has been in the past two years.

There are a number of potential explanations for that, including seasonal changes in cloud migrations, and increasing difficulties on Amazon didn't provide an explanation for that, but it likely has to do with AWS's growing revenue base overall.

Continuing growth is a positive sign for AWS, which is locked in tight competition with companies including Microsoft and Google to try and power the next generation of business applications.

Amazon said AWS launched 1,019 new features in 2016 as part of that push.

Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud revenue segment brought in $6.9 billion in revenue during the same period. However, that also includes revenue from sources beyond its Azure cloud platform, including licenses for software including Windows Server and SQL Server.

A series of price cuts for AWS services kicked in during the quarter. Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky said on a conference call with financial analysts that such cuts are "going to be a constant in this business."

It's unclear exactly what impact they may have had on the cloud provider's overall financial results.

Overall, Amazon's fourth quarter revenue was $43.7 billion, up 22 percent from $35.7 billion at the end of 2015.

The company's fourth quarter profit was $749 million, compared to $482 million during the prior year quarter.

Graças a otários corajosos early-adopters como você, que pagaram ágio enorme no brinquedo de US$ 60, a Nintendo decidiu continuar a produzir o mini-NES.

O plano da Nintendo era fazer do Famicom / Nintendo Classic Mini uma edição limitada enquanto o Switch não chega mas, com a demanda ainda bastante elevada, a empresa decidiu por bem continuar a fornecer o aparelho ao mercado por pelo menos mais um trimestre.



NES Classic Edition global sell-through 1.5 million; increasing production. — Takashi Mochizuki (@mochi_wsj) 1 de fevereiro de 2017

É o que foi decidido durante uma recente reunião do conselho administrativo da empresa, após revelarem que o NES Classic Edition já vendeu mais de 1,5 milhão de unidades globalmente. A conta inclui o Nintendo Classic Mini (EU) e o Famicom Classic Mini (JP).

Em vez de manter o conservadorismo japonês nas encomendas ou mesmo fazer um marketing de escassez como a velha Nintendo dos tempos do SNES (algo que influenciou inclusive empresas novatas como a Apple), aparentemente o presidente Tatsumi Kimishima quer mesmo fazer a Big N ganhar dinheiro com os saudosistas.

E a descoberta de brechas que permitem a adição de mais jogos pode fazer a alegria do povo da pirataria. Todos ganham, exceto quem pagou ágio enorme dos especuladores.

Your high-flying experience is about to go high-tech. On Thursday, IBM, United Airlines, and Apple announced a collaboration that aims to serve up a new generation of mobile apps for United employees. With hopes of “unleashing the power of the more than 50,000 iOS devices,” IBM and Apple seek to redefine how work is done, starting at United Airlines. Promising a new suite of made-for-business apps, the lineup will be aimed at driving the airline’s digital transformation and helping customer service.

“United Airlines is committed to delivering positive traveler experiences that begin with front-line engagements during all points of the passenger journey — from check-in to departure to destination,” said Dee Waddell, global managing director, for travel and transportation industries at IBM. “This enhanced strategy with mobile solutions from IBM and Apple allows United Airlines employees to tap into the right information at the right time to instantaneously address the needs that matter most to passengers.”

Technology has long played an integral role in United’s strategy. Particularly over the last few years, United has equipped its employees with iPhones and iPads to create a more seamless customer experience. “We want to put our employees in a position to deliver exceptional service at every step of the travel experience,” said Jason Birnbaum, United’s vice president of operations technology. “We have incredible employees out in the field who rely on technology to help our customers. The mobile solutions and working closely with IBM and Apple enables us to provide innovative solutions for them on an unprecedented scale.”

With the new apps, flight attendants ought to have a better sense of which customers have connecting flights, so they can better help them find their gates. Customer service agents will also have more autonomy in moving around, rather than being tied to their desks. So get excited, friends. Technology just may make your travel experience that much better. In global politics and in fashion, every nation needs a good ambassador. Denmark—where Copenhagen Fashion Week is currently in full swing—has one in Pernille Teisbaek , who has become a street style fixture and Instagram demigoddess for her low-key, natural beauty and playful, relatable twists on trends. And though the former stylist and blogger is preparing to welcome her first child, a boy, in six weeks, pregnancy hasn’t slowed her down one bit: In August, she launched Social Zoo, a consulting agency, with her agent and business partner, Hannah Løffler Schmidt, and she’s kept her street style game on point all along, pairing easy beauty looks (she almost never wears makeup—even for the cameras!) with statement pieces carefully layered to accentuate her silhouette (and an ever-present pair of Vetements Reeboks for comfort on the go).

Last night, Teisbaek opened up her airy, white-on-white apartment—and well-stocked beauty cabinet—to share her secrets to a healthy and chic pregnancy, from her fitness routine to her unusual choice of face cream.

Stay active.

“I used to be a runner, but I followed the advice I got from my birth helper—or what you’d call a doula—to start riding a stationary bike instead, which gives your body more support. Every morning, I ride for 20 or 30 minutes on the bike at home, and then I also cycle 10 minutes each way to my office. I’ve been doing it even on weekends, and the good thing about it is that I don’t have any water retention in my legs or anywhere else, which I was told is because of my daily exercise.”

Embrace carbs.

“In the beginning, I couldn’t eat any veggies because I would get nauseous, but after three months, I could eat normally again. My body has been screaming for more carbs—which I didn’t eat before. I really love oatmeal in the morning with a little bit of cinnamon and honey on top—it gives me so much energy. I always have a bag of salty almonds, or almonds and raisins, just to pull up the energy at the end of the day. Otherwise, I’ve been eating everything.

Call in the wellness squad.

“I’ve done a lot of reflexology and cranial sacral therapy, and I’m going to start doing some prenatal massage leading up to the birth. I mostly did reflexology in the beginning to kind of make sure that the baby had everything it should have—it can boost the immune system and the blood circulation that goes through to the baby. The cranial sacral is actually more about stress relief; I’ve been going about once a month. But it helps with other things: My hips are not straight, so the therapist has been helping me balance them out. And I spent New Year’s in Los Angeles, when I was at about seven and a half months. When I got back, I had a lot of contractions and went to see her. She could see that the head was not down straight, so she kind of moved him in the right direction and then it stopped. It was pretty amazing. I love her. She’s a genius. You have to have your helpers.”

Discover the world of organic skin care.

“I use an anti-aging serum from Rudolph, this organic Danish brand. I’ve been getting facials from an organic line called Friis . The owner does these ‘Botox massages.’ You’re red and glowing afterward because she goes hard-core into all the wrinkles and muscle contractions—they’re kind of pulled out.

“My other favorite products right now are Karmameju Star Micellar Water to remove makeup, and Weleda Stretch Mark Massage Oil on my stomach. And I use Tata Harper’s masks when I think my skin needs something more; I sleep with them and sometimes mix them together. I think they’re quite efficient.”

Think outside the product category.

“For daytime, I’ve been using Weleda Almond Sensitive Skin Hand Cream on my face! I was talking with them about how my skin was acting and I was like, ‘I need something really rich for supersensitive skin,’ and they were like, ‘Well, we have this hand lotion.’ And it works!”

Mind your synthetic fragrances . . .

“My signature scent is Santal 33 by Le Labo, but these days, if I use it, it’s on my clothes but not my skin. I don’t really use it that much because I don’t want the [synthetic] chemicals on my body. I miss it sometimes, but you kind of get used to it.”

. . . But allow yourself some guilty pleasures.

“I didn’t dye my hair for a while, and I tried organic shampoos, but it got greasy more quickly. So Kevin Murphy Maxi Wash and Angel Rinse have really worked for me. I’m really trying to be organic. But I still want to do my nails; I still want to dye my hair; I still want to be a human being and look great. I bought some eco nail polish that I brought to the salon, but it chipped after like two days, and I just got tired of it. So I actually went and had gel manicures a few times. I think it’s important that you don’t go too hippie and forget about yourself. When your body changes that much, you need these small things that make you feel more pretty and elegant.”

Keep your style comfortable.

“The oversize trends that we have been seeing from Vetements and Balenciaga have been really handy for me. You can wear something you’d want to be in all day like pajamas, and style it up with a pair of pumps. It has always been my approach to combine something casual with something less casual.”

Master your belly strategy.

“When your belly gets really big, you want to wear something slightly more tight. In the beginning, you feel like a mushroom in front, and you just want to hide it. I was wearing a lot of high-waisted skirts, because they still made me feel like I had a waist. I bought a lot of vintage boyfriend jeans and stretchy stirrup pants from Totême because I didn’t want to wear any maternity pants. The combination of a vintage T-shirt with a blazer on top has been working for me. I haven’t really been buying things for pregnancy but mostly investing in things I’ll want to wear after as well—accessories, jackets, jewelry, things you can use again.” Where the hipsters now roam, suds makers like Schnaderbeck once reigned. He was not the largest brewer in Brooklyn in the days before slogans like “my beer is Rheingold, the dry beer” were on people’s lips. But Williamsburg and Bushwick became a home to foam in the mid-19th century, and eventually Brooklyn became the beer capital of the nation, producing one-fifth of the nation’s beer as recently as 1960.

The Rheingold and Schaefer breweries shut down their Brooklyn plants in the 1970s, leaving Brooklyn without beer makers until Brooklyn Brewery set up shop in 1988.

Dr. Bergoffen, an adjunct associate professor at the Fashion Institute of Technology who also takes on projects for architects and developers, says Schnaderbeck’s beer vaults now have the distinction of being the only ones in Brooklyn to have been mapped and photographed by archaeologists — even though Schnaderbeck remains a mystery.

“His career,” she said, “seems to have been respectable but not particularly distinguished.” His brewery did not last into the 20th century. If he drowned his sorrows or drowned in debt — a lager laggard in a time when brewing was prosperous — she turned up no clues.

The most dramatic stories about him, taken mostly from newspaper accounts, have nothing to do with beer. Once a servant in Schnaderbeck’s house mistook arsenic for baking soda. The pudding she made poisoned Schnaderbeck’s family. “Luckily, the doctor arrived in time to save the family,” Dr. Bergoffen said.

Another time, a man who had been staying in Schnaderbeck’s house died in bed. The Brooklyn Daily Eagle said the coroner attributed the death to natural causes until a packet of strychnine was found “in the bed he had lain on.” The cause of death was changed to suicide.

“Apparently, Schnaderbeck had known about the packet,” Dr. Bergoffen wrote in one of her archaeological assessments, “but ‘kept mum’ as he said, ‘It was bad enough to have the old scoundrel die in my bed without having any more bother about him.’”

Schnaderbeck had immigrated in 1848 from Germany and was originally in the wine business in Manhattan, but lived in Williamsburg. By the Civil War, Brooklyn had 30 breweries, and in 1870, The Eagle said some brewers had cellars that reached depths of 80 feet. They had “as much or more space below the surface as above,” The Eagle said, and cellars were “attached to every brewery” — including Schnaderbeck’s, on Ten Eyck Street.

Dr. Bergoffen found that he also built a distinctive red brick building around the corner on Maujer Street, long since converted to apartments, that was his brewery.

The vaults were discovered when a construction crew began clearing the site for an 18-unit apartment building, part of a $23.8 million project covering five buildings in the neighborhood, including one next door at 37 Ten Eyck Street.

“They never expected to find anything,” said Dr. Bergoffen, who was called in by the developer, Yuco Real Estate Company, after the backhoe hit the top of one of the vaults.

“I’d never seen one,” she said, “and as far as I know, there’s only one other that has been preserved in Williamsburg.” There are not many other purposes for a cool, dark space. Aging artisanal cheese is one, and a part of the other vault is used for that these days, she said.

A lack of refrigeration meant beer was intensely local. Brewers catered to their immediate neighborhoods. “If you wanted to drink Schnaderbeck’s beer, you came to Schnaderbeck’s,” she said. “They must have had a nice place in there because they had a ‘congress hall’ in there for political meetings” after the brewery closed. Later still, she said, there was talk of turning the building into a theater.

Schnaderbeck’s brewery went out of business in the late 1870s, and Dr. Bergoffen found a mysterious notation in tax records that said the Ten Eyck Street building was “in ruins 1880.” There were no indications as to why.

The low-income housing project was proposed 10 years ago and won city approval, Dr. Bergoffen said there were no indications that anything of historical interest was on the site. Old city maps said nothing about underground beer vaults, she said.

Once the vaults were discovered, the project was delayed for a year while discussions were held on what to do about them. Dr. Bergoffen said she argued for preserving them.

“Why not have a beer hall?” she wrote in AIA New York Society News, a newsletter of the New York branch of the Archaeological Institute of America. “Microbreweries are popular in Williamsburg, and the hipsters would love it.”

But she wrote that the developer rejected the idea because the renovations would have been too expensive.

Three of the vaults have been filled with concrete. A fourth was left alone, but is no longer accessible. A call to Yuco’s office in Manhattan was not returned.

The building on Ten Eyck Street “was intended to be low-income housing,” Dr. Bergoffen said. “They couldn’t imagine a commercial space in a subbasement with low-income tenants above.” There were a lot of happy faces in the travel section of the PGA Merchandise Show this year, thanks in large part to the strong dollar. Scotland and Ireland, the biggest international golf destinations, reported strong doubledigit growth in golf tourism.

Here are five key takeaways from conversations with

tour operators and tourism officials:

MONEY MATTERS – Despite the strong dollar,

international travel remains largely a rich-man’s game.

We’re talking about people who have the means to travel

regardless of the currency situation.

“Since 2009, that dreaded ‘1 percent’ has done

extremely well,” said Sam Baker, founder of tour operator

Haversham & Baker.

The currency advantage might not be enough incentive

to get less affluent golfers to travel overseas, Baker said,

but it “causes the people who are going to travel anyway

to trade up to more luxury, which is usually in the hotel

choices, or they stay longer and put other bells and

whistles in their trips.

Needless to say, this is a good time to be a tour operator.

Gordon Dalgleish, co-founder of PerryGolf, said his

company has been posting strong double-digit revenue

gains, and Baker said his business has doubled over the

past eight years.

GO GREEN – Because of the strong dollar, noted

Alison Metcalfe, executive vice president of Tourism

Ireland, “A lot of my European colleagues who are

promoting other destinations will say, ‘Europe is on sale.’

It’s up to us individually to fight for our (share).”

Ireland appears to be more than holding its own,

capturing 10 percent of American visitors to Europe.

Among the biggest beneficiaries are the links and hotels

along Ireland’s northwest coast.

“Years ago we were maybe the third choice after

you went to the southwest or the east coast,” said John

McLaughlin, who runs North and West Coast Links.

Now the northwest is in the spotlight. The Irish Open,

now part of the European Tour’s Rolex Series, will be

played at Portstewart two weeks before the British Open.

The tournament likely will stay in the northwest in 2018,

and the British Open will make a long-overdue return to

Royal Portrush in 2019.

“Our courses are very hungry,” McLaughlin said.

“We’ve been working at this for a long, long time, and

opportunities are starting to come.”

That’s paying dividends all along the west coast.

“(Golf tourism is) our fastest-growing market segment,”

said Alan Maloney, owner of Mount Falcon Estate, a

popular retreat for golfers in County Mayo. “I think it’s a

trend that was happening anyway, and it’s accelerated by

the currency.”

BOOK EARLY – It’s getting increasingly difficult to

get tee times on the most famous links. Baker, for example,

noted that Royal County Down sold out its entire 2017

inventory of tourist tee times before Christmas.

“We’re just running out of inventory far earlier than we

ever have before,” he said.

This will cause some positive ripple effects. As Dalgleish

said, “You can’t go over 100 percent at St. Andrews.” His

point is that if golfers can’t land the choicest tee times,

they’ll fill in their itineraries with other links that they

might not otherwise have visited.

Baker said this tourism boom also is creating a

rationalization for developers to open new courses. In

Scotland alone, Mark Parsinen is building a second course

at Castle Stuart, Mike Keiser has a links projects in the

works, and a second course has been announced for

Trump International near Aberdeen.

HEY, BIG SPENDERS! – Yes, that means you

tourists lugging your golf travel bags up to the Aer Lingus

and British Airways counters. The tourism folks overseas

want to party with you guys. And why not? Metcalfe

noted that golfers account for only about 9 percent of total

visitors to Ireland but spend at least twice as much as

other leisure travelers.

“So it’s an extremely important market for us,” she said.

SAIL AWAY – Dalgleish said cruises account for

about 25 percent of PerryGolf’s business. This is a couples

business; golf is part of the itineraries but isn’t dominant.

Dalgleish noted that “cruisers are very loyal,” which

means repeat business. And this category opens up new

destinations that wouldn’t normally occur to golf tourists.

Later this year, for example, PerryGolf is running an

Arabian Gulf cruise that includes five rounds of golf over

10 days with stops in Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Oman, Qatar and

Bahrain.

“It’s really hard to get your head around the fact that

you’re in a seriously bad neighborhood, and it’s completely

safe,” Dalgleish said Friday, 3 February, 2017 - 11:40

The latest New Zealand Manufacturers and Exporters Association (NZMEA) Survey of Business Conditions completed during January 2017, shows total sales in December 2016 increased 7.23% (year on year export sales increased by 10.01% with domestic sales increasing by 3.30%) on December 2015.

In the 3 months to December, export sales decreased an average of 1.4%, and domestic sales increased 11.7% on average.

The NZMEA survey sample this month covered NZ$275m in annualised sales, with an export content of 60%.

Net confidence rose to 10, up from 8 in November.

The current performance index (a combination of profitability and cash flow) is at 99.3, up from 98.3 last month, the change index (capacity utilisation, staff levels, orders and inventories) was at 101, with no change from the last survey, and the forecast index (investment, sales, profitability and staff) is at 104.5, up on the last result of 103.2. Anything over 100 indicates expansion.

Constraints reported were 78% markets and 22% skilled staff.

A net 45% of respondents reported a productivity increase in December.

Staff numbers decreased 7.9% year on year in December.

Supervisors, tradespersons, managers, professional/scientists and operators/labourers reported a moderate shortage.

"December’s manufacturing sales results showed a good bounce back from the results seen in October, September and July, particularly in export sales - manufacturers ended the year on a high note." Said Dieter Adam.

"Export sales in December improved 10.01% on the same month in 2015, which was higher than the increase of 6.44% reported in November. These results translated into an average month decrease of -1.4% in the 3 months to December, which was still held down in the negative due to a poor month for exports in October.

"Domestic sales in December stayed positive with a 3.3% increase on December 2015. This was, however, a moderation on the exceptional growth felt in the previous three months. The average monthly growth of domestic sales in the 3 months to December remained high at 11.7%.

"We can now get a good picture on how the manufacturing sector fared in 2016. Domestic sales experienced an average monthly growth of 5.8% on the previous year’s months over the last 12 months, representing a positive trend of domestic sales. Export sales saw an average monthly growth of 2.1% in the same period. 2016 most definitely had its ups and downs for manufacturing sales, but overall, the trend showed solid growth for the year overall.

"The downward trend in export sales towards the end of the year was concerning - though the last two months of the year did turn this around somewhat. Weak export numbers have been reflected in the Statistics New Zealand numbers - in December, mechanical machinery and equipment exports fell 8.83% on December 2015, while electrical machinery and equipment fell 13.5%. This is a reminder that we need to renew focus on building high-value exports and push for growth in these areas. " Said Dieter.

RIO - O governo do Rio publicará, nos próximos dias, um decreto para a instalação de uma Comissão de Acompanhamento dos Incentivos Fiscais. Além das secretarias da Casa Civil e Desenvolvimento Econômico e de Fazenda e Planejamento, a comissão terá integrantes do Ministério Público estadual, do Tribunal de Contas, da Procuradoria Geral do Estado, da Assembleia Legislativa e da Associação Estadual dos Municípios do Rio de Janeiro (Aemerj). Nesta quinta-feira, o secretário da Casa Civil, Christino Áureo, coordenou reunião, no Palácio Guanabara, para delinear as diretrizes para a criação da Comissão.

Segundo nota divulgada pelo governo, o procurador-geral de Justiça, Eduardo Gussem, disse estar otimista com os resultados da iniciativa que, na avaliação dele, representará um avanço na governança dos incentivos fiscais no estado. E, para o promotor de Justiça Vinícius Cavalleiro, a Comissão representará um avanço institucional na concessão e fiscalização dos incentivos.

Christino Áureo explicou que a Comissão permitirá reunir visões divergentes em um diálogo que atenderá aos interesses da sociedade e do estado, com melhoria na governança e transparência dos incentivos. De acordo com o secretário, a Comissão fará uma análise conjunta de projetos já em implantação, em função dos empregos a serem gerados e dos impactos de curto prazo na economia estadual.

Em dezembro, o governador Luiz Fernando Pezão sancionou a Lei 7.495/16, que proíbe a concessão de novos incentivos e benefícios fiscais de natureza tributária a empresas pelos próximos dois anos. Pelo texto, no entanto, as empresas enquadradas em isenções já em vigor permanecem com seus direitos, inclusive com a hipótese de renovação dos benefícios, desde que aprovados por lei ou pelo Conselho Nacional de Política Fazendária (Confaz). The rocketship of cloud growth continued at the end of 2016 for Amazon Web Services.

The public cloud provider announced Thursday that it brought in a little more than US$3.5 billion during the fourth quarter of last year, up 47 percent from the same period in 2015.

Quarterly operating income rose 60 percent to $926 million, compared to $580 million during the prior year quarter.

That's nothing to sneeze at, but AWS's revenue growth was the lowest it has been in the past two years.

There are a number of potential explanations for that, including seasonal changes in cloud migrations, and increasing difficulties on Amazon didn't provide an explanation for that, but it likely has to do with AWS's growing revenue base overall.

Continuing growth is a positive sign for AWS, which is locked in tight competition with companies including Microsoft and Google to try and power the next generation of business applications.

Amazon said AWS launched 1,019 new features in 2016 as part of that push.

Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud revenue segment brought in $6.9 billion in revenue during the same period. However, that also includes revenue from sources beyond its Azure cloud platform, including licenses for software including Windows Server and SQL Server.

A series of price cuts for AWS services kicked in during the quarter. Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky said on a conference call with financial analysts that such cuts are "going to be a constant in this business."

It's unclear exactly what impact they may have had on the cloud provider's overall financial results.

Overall, Amazon's fourth quarter revenue was $43.7 billion, up 22 percent from $35.7 billion at the end of 2015.

The company's fourth quarter profit was $749 million, compared to $482 million during the prior year quarter.

� 2017 Nasdaq, Inc. All rights reserved. Auto-industry supplier Delphi Automotive PLC (NYSE:DLPH) reported its fourth-quarter and full-year 2016 earnings on February 2. Here's what investors need to know.

Delphi earnings: The raw numbers

Metric Q4 16 Change vs. Q4 2015 Full-year 2016 Change vs. 2015 Revenue $4.3B 11% $16.7B 10% Adjusted operating income $606M 20.5% $2.223B 12.8% Net income (GAAP) $281M 41% $1.152B (3.1)% Earnings per share $1.03 47% $4.21 1.6% Cash from operations $683M 7.1% $1.941B 16.4%

What happened at Delphi in the fourth quarter of 2016

Delphi's 47% year-over-year gain in net income in the fourth quarter was driven largely by growth in sales of the advanced technologies that are supporting the industry's (and Delphi's) evolution toward fully self-driving vehicles.

The company booked $9 billion in new business in the fourth quarter, a substantial percentage of it in high-tech areas: active safety, infotainment, and vehicle electrification. Delphi is emerging as a leader in active-safety systems, having partnered with machine-vision expert Mobileye with the intent to bring a "Level 4" self-driving system to market by the end of 2019. The partners may be first to market.

Delphi's adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 14.1%, up from 13% a year ago. That was a result of increased earnings from the acquisition of HellermannTyton in late 2015, the impact of cost-cutting efforts, including movement to lower-cost manufacturing locations in Europe, and above-market sales growth in all regions, the company said in a statement.

Delphi's new business bookings totaled $26 billion for the full year.

What Delphi's CEO said about the quarter

CEO Kevin Clark hailed what he called a record quarter during the company's earnings conference call.

We had a record quarter, delivering revenue and earnings growth above the top end of our guidance range. Revenue increased 10% in the quarter and 8% for the full year. Operating income increased 20% in the quarter and 13% for the full year with margin expansion and double-digit earnings growth in every quarter. And we continue to convert more income to cash, allowing us to reinvest in our business and return cash to shareholders, which totaled almost $1 billion in 2016 between dividends and share repurchases. We expect more of the same in 2017 with strong growth in sales, earnings and cash flow, reinforcing the fact that our business model is working. Our portfolio of market-relevant technologies is driving revenue growth in every business and we continue to optimize our cost structure. And as a result, we believe we're well positioned for the long term.

Looking ahead: Delphi's guidance for 2017

Here are the company's expectations for key metrics in 2017.

Revenue between $16.5 billion and $16.9 billion.

Operating income between $2.185 billion and $2.285 billion.

Earrings per share between $6.40 and $6.70.

Copyright (C) 2017 PR Newswire. All rights reserved Ferrari N.V. (NYSE:RACE) said on February 2 that its adjusted core earnings rose 38%, to 251 million euros ($270.7 million), in the fourth quarter on a strong year-over-year increase in revenue. That was ahead of the 225 million euro result expected by Wall Street analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. The Italian supercar maker's shares jumped 4% after the news was announced.

Ferrari earnings: The raw numbers

All financial numbers are shown in millions of euros. As of February 2, one euro = $1.08 U.S. dollar.

Metric Q4 2016 Change vs. Q4 15 Full-year 2016 Change vs. 2015 Vehicles shipped 1,940 (4)% 8,014 5% Revenue 836 12% 2,854 9% EBIDTA 224 42% 719 17% Adjusted EBIDTA 251 38% 748 18% Net income 112 103% 290 38%

Ferrari's "net industrial debt," its debt in excess of its cash balance and receivables, totaled 653 million euros at the end of 2016, down from 797 million euros at the end of 2015.

What happened at Ferrari during the quarter

Despite a year-over-year drop in the total number of vehicles shipped, Ferrari's revenue rose 12% in the fourth quarter from a year ago. That gain was powered primarily by a big jump in revenue from engines built by Ferrari for racing teams and for former corporate parent Fiat Chrysler Automobiles' (NYSE:FCAU) luxury Maserati brand.

Strong sales of Ferrari's more-profitable 12-cylinder models, particularly the GTC4Lusso and the limited-run (and extremely exclusive) LaFerrari Aperta, a hybrid convertible supercar, also helped, as did a jump in sponsorship revenue from Ferrari's racing activities.

What Ferrari's CEO had to say

Noting that Ferrari's adjusted earnings before interest, depreciation, taxes, and amortization (EBIDTA) margin was a whopping 30% for the fourth quarter, up from 24.3% in the year-ago period, CEO Sergio Marchionne attributed the profitability gain to a couple of factors.

We're now in a position to clock about 30% EBIDTA numbers. This is a combination of a couple of things. One, the comments that we have taken to heart from most of the investors that we've spoken to about the pricing power of Ferrari. We have made some strides, I don't think we've made all of the strides necessary to reflect adequate pricing for what we produce, but I think we certainly have moved the agenda forward on the topic. And equally important, I think we've become a lot more rigorous in terms of cost within the house. This is reflected in the operating margin for the business.

Marchionne said that Ferrari has a number of new limited-production products in the works that should keep profitability strong. But, he said, a Ferrari SUV isn't in the cards.

We keep getting phenomenal pressure from the outside about doing one, because everybody knows that if Ferrari did an SUV, we could sell it. I struggle to see a car that can be sold by Ferrari that does not have the driving dynamics of one of our passenger cars. We have to be sufficiently disciplined not to bastardize the brand.

Looking ahead: Ferrari's guidance for 2017

Assuming that exchange rates stay roughly constant, Ferrari expects the following performance for the full year in 2017: Want to know about the high-yield global income stock I found this week?

Kingfa Science and Technology (USA) Inc., which now has just 27 employees, expects to add 150 jobs during the next three years, human resources manager Christina Zamenski said Thursday. The company uses plastic compounds to make raw materials for plastic injection molding companies that, in turn, supply parts to the auto industry.

Kingfa is a subsidiary of China-based Kingfa Science and Technology Ltd., and one of the world's largest suppliers of engineering plastic resins. The company opened its Canton facility last March.

"We've had steady growth," Zamenski said, adding that 25-30 of the new jobs are expected this year. "Things are going great."

The company's growth comes as the Michigan Economic Development Corp., confirmed Kingfa will receive a $1 million performance-based grant through the Michigan Business Development Program. Kingfa also is expected to seek tax abatements from Canton Township.

Township Supervisor Pat Williams said talks have been ongoing.

"Now that it appears it's coming to fruition, we are nothing but excited," he said, saying the plan brings quality jobs to the Canton area.

Kingfa was one of four companies in Michigan to win state support to invest $76.8 million and add 555 jobs in southeast Michigan, the MEDC announced.

Kingfa was chosen over a competing company in Ohio.

Zamenski said Kingfa's hiring needs are expected to expand this summer and be spread out over three years. She said the growth pertains to new equipment and employees; the actual building isn't being expanded.

Williams said Canton Economic Development Manager Kristen Thomas is working with Kingfa for a proposed tax abatement that will be submitted for approval to the Canton Township Board of Trustees, though final details were not yet available.

"It's certainly something I would be supportive of and would present to the full board when the details mature," Williams said, adding the plan will lead to "more quality automotive jobs" in the Canton area.

The MEDC said Kingfa is primarily engaged in the research, development, production and sale of modified plastic products, with its main products including flame-retardant resins, reinforced resins, toughened resins and polymeric alloys, among other products.

The MEDC said other companies receiving state support to grow are ABB, Inc. of Auburn Hills, Macomb Smoked Meats of Macomb Township and Valeo North America, Inc., which plans to expand in Auburn Hills and Troy.

Commerce, Trade and Industry Minister Margaret Mwanakatwe says the move is meant to protect the local industry.

Mrs Mwanakatwe said the move will be monitored by various government agencies as it is in line with the government strategy of diversification and industrialization.

ZANIS reports the minister said during a Press Briefing,at her office on Monday that various economic players and the general citizenry should support the government’s move for economic growth and sustainability.

She added that the move will also help facilitate the creation of decent jobs and business linkages in the country.

Edible oil industry has been identified as one of the key sub sectors of the manufacturing sector with potential to make the country self-sufficient in the production of cooking oil and other by-products, she said.

Meanwhile, the Minister also announced that the sale of live birds on wholesale and retail basis at markets will be reserved for citizens and local companies after the publication of the Reservation Scheme Statutory instrument.

Mrs Mwanakatwe explained that the Reservation Scheme was approved by the Republican President and is currently being published at the Government Printing Department.

She further said domestic haulage for all public procurement works will also be reserved for citizens, citizen influenced, citizen-empowered and citizen owned companies while other companies will continue to operate for private works.

Mrs Mwanakatwe explained that the scheme will apply to poultry and domestic haulage for public procurement with immediate effect from the date the Statutory Instrument will be published.

She added that any person who undertakes business in the reserved activities will be guilty of an offence and liable upon conviction to a specified fine and imprisonment.

Bloomfield Township Police say a suspected seafood thief was caught with more than $300 worth of lobster, shrimp and salmon.

The incident was reported Jan. 31 at a Kroger supermarket on 3600 W. Maple Road. Police say the suspect pushed a shopping cart filled with groceries out of the store without paying for any items.

Police say employees confronted the suspect in the store parking lot, at which point he left the cart and walked away. Arriving officers quickly caught up to the man hiding in a nearby business.

David Moses Chahine, 47, of Dearborn, was arraigned Wednesday on one count of first-degree retail fraud in 48th District Court. His bond was set at $10,000 pending a probable cause hearing Feb. 9.

Le patron d'Uber, Travis Kalanick, a quitté jeudi un forum stratégique de dirigeants d'entreprises chargé de conseiller le président américain Donald Trump, dont la politique controversée sur l'immigration commençait à peser sur l'activité du service de réservation de voitures avec chauffeur.

"Plus tôt aujourd'hui, j'ai parlé brièvement avec le président de son décret sur l'immigration et des problèmes pour notre communauté. Je lui ai aussi faire savoir que je ne pourrai pas participer à son conseil économique", a annoncé Travis Kalanick aux salariés d'Uber dans un courriel interne dont l'AFP a obtenu une copie.

"Rejoindre le groupe (de conseillers économiques) n'était pas censé être une validation du président ou de son agenda, mais malheureusement cela a été mal interprété exactement comme si cela l'était", ajoute-t-il.

Donald Trump a suspendu par décret l'entrée aux Etats-Unis des ressortissants de sept pays à majorité musulmane (Iran, Irak, Yémen, Somalie, Soudan, Syrie et Libye) et de tous les réfugiés, le temps de revoir les critères d'octroi de visas.

Ce décret a provoqué une levée de boucliers, en particulier dans le secteur technologique où les dirigeants de Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Apple, Amazon et Netflix ont notamment exprimé leurs inquiétudes.

Uber a toutefois été critiqué pour sa réponse jugée un peu trop tiède, et les appels se sont multipliés ces derniers jours pour que les utilisateurs suppriment leurs comptes et se tournent plutôt vers le service concurrent Lyft, notamment sur Twitter avec le mot clé #DeleteUber.

Une pétition en ligne appelant Travis Kalanick à démissionner du conseil présidentiel avait également été lancée jeudi par une "guilde" représentant les chauffeurs Uber new-yorkais.

"C'est une importante démonstration de solidarité envers les chauffeurs immigrés qui ont aidé à construire Uber et sont plus de 40.000 rien qu'à New York. Nous sommes rassurés qu'Uber écoute les chauffeurs et la communauté (des utilisateurs) sur cette question importante, qui fait partie intégrante de la promesse du rêve américain", s'est félicité le fondateur de cette guilde, Jim Conigliaro.

Le forum stratégique, qui avait été mis sur pied après l'élection de Donald Trump, compte une vingtaine de patrons d'entreprises. Travis Kalanick y était le principal représentant du secteur technologique, avec le milliardaire Elon Musk (Tesla, SpaceX) et la patronne d'IBM Ginni Rometty. Il doit se réunir vendredi.

  The Switch should be competing with the iPad, not the Xbox One or PS4 SANT’ANGELO. È il 24 febbraio l’ultimo giorno utile per presentare richieste di risarcimento per il maltempo a Città Sant'Angelo. La modulistica potrà essere consegnata da cittadini e imprese del territorio angolano che hanno subìto danni in seguito all'ondata straordinaria di neve che si è abbattuta su tutto l’Abruzzo a gennaio.

«L'amministrazione si è mossa a pieno ritmo per poter svolgere con sollecitudine tutti gli atti propedeutici, affinché cittadini e imprese colpiti potessero comunicare in fretta i danni subiti», spiega il sindaco Gabriele Florindi. La giunta aveva approvato, lo scorso 23 gennaio, lo stato di emergenza e calamità naturale per il territorio comunale, procedendo nei giorni successivi, il 31 gennaio, all'approvazione della delibera per la conferma dello stato di emergenza con allegata la modulistica occorrente per la richiesta di risarcimento».

I moduli, scaricabili dal sito istituzionale del Comune di Città Sant'Angelo, potranno essere richiesti anche in formato cartaceo nell'ufficio relazioni con il pubblico (Urp) nella sede municipale, in piazza IV Novembre.

«Si tratta di un servizio importante. Purtroppo, anche la nostra comunità è stata fortemente colpita da questa grave ondata di maltempo e i danni sono davvero ingenti» sottolinea Florindi. «Aggiungo che non sarà il Comune a decidere sulla possibilità dei rimborsi, il nostro ente farà solo da tramite e si è impegnato al massimo affinché tutti gli atti necessari a queste richieste fossero pronti nel più breve tempo possibile». I rimborsi, infatti, saranno erogati soltanto «nel caso in cui il governo centrale riconoscerà effettivamente all'Abruzzo lo stato di calamità naturale, affidando poi alla Regione il compito e i fondi per i risarcimenti».

Sono tre le tipologie di richieste possibili, suddivise in altrettante differenti schede: la prima, potrà essere presentata da quei cittadini che hanno subìto danni ad «abitazioni, magazzini, annessi e strutture»; la seconda, si rivolge alle imprese; la terza, infine, potrà essere presentata da chi ha avuto danni a elettrodomestici in seguito all'interruzione dell’energia elettrica.

Cittadini e imprese che sono stati lasciati senza energia elettrica, invece, non dovranno presentare richieste, giacché i rimborsi saranno erogati direttamente in bolletta a partire da marzo.

I moduli per ottenere il risarcimento dei danni da maltempo potranno essere consegnati a mano all'ufficio

protocollo del Comune di Città Sant'Angelo, ma sarà possibile presentare le domande anche attraverso raccomandata postale o posta elettronica certificata (da inviare all'indirizzo di posta elettronica).

©RIPRODUZIONE RISERVATA   For the Footwear News Jan. 30 issue, pop sensation Katy Perry graced the cover with an exciting new business venture.

While Perry has stayed busy accruing Grammy nominations and eight No. 1 hits on the Billboard Hot 100, she was also researching for her very own shoe line.

This week's issue featuring @katyperry is here! The singer is taking on the footwear industry with her new line, @katyperrycollections. Read our interview with her and see the shoes at the link in our bio. #fnissue #katyperry #kpshoes #katyperrycollections --: @ronyalwin A photo posted by Footwear News (@footwearnews) on Jan 30, 2017 at 10:03am PST

In the cover feature, Perry tells Footwear News about her journey to becoming a shoe designer. “[Footwear] was a part of me that needed to be carefully created and developed, and I had to weigh a lot of my options,” Perry says of her meetings with Tommy Hilfiger and Vince Camuto and Italian factory visits. “I want to learn a lot, master it and become a serious contributor in the fashion world.”

For her shoe line, the pop star partnered with fashion and entertainment management company Global Brands Group and works with former stylist Johnny Wujek for creative direction. Perry emphasizes her signature whimsical fashion sense in her line with bunny-faced flats, mules with Cuban cigar-shaped heels, and aesthetic influences from her love of outer space.

The singer also emphasizes the importance of economic access -- after all, Global Brands predicts her global market will be as young as 16 years old -- and retails her shoes in a range from $59 to $299. “Everybody has more important things to spend their money on -- whether it’s their children, or their family or their health,” Perry tells Footwear News. “At the end of the day, your personality shouldn’t be so expensive to display.”

So far, retailers Lord & Taylor, Amazon.com, Macy’s and Zappos will officially carry Perry’s collection. US-based Seagate, the world’s biggest maker of hard disk drives, closed its factory in Suzhou near Shanghai last month with the loss of 2,000 jobs, in a move that has rekindled fears that China is becoming increasingly hostile towards foreign firms operating in the country.

A passionate speech presented by Chinese president Xi Jinping at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos in early January had been hoped to address the issue, and reassure investors that China’s remained open to foreign investment.

Xi defended globalisation and promised improved market access for foreign companies, a positive sign seen by many that China is still sticking firmly to its opening up policies, first rolled out by late leader Deng Xiaoping in the 1980s.

Yet, Seagate joined a spate of foreign companies to shutter operations in China in recent years, for various reasons, but most have attributed the country’s high tax regime, rising labour costs and fierce competition from domestic companies.

Panasonic, for instance, stopped all its manufacturing of televisions in the country in 2015 after 37 years of operating in China.

China doesn’t need foreign companies so badly now in terms of acquiring advanced technology and capital as in previous years, so of course, the government is likely to gradually phase out more of these preferential policies for foreign firms

Professor Chong Tai-Leung, Chinese University of Hong Kong

When it first opened in 1979, the Japanese home electronics corporation was the country’s first foreign firm, tempted by generous benefits not offered to its Chinese competitors, including lower taxes and land prices and easier access to local governments.

But almost four decades down the road, this certainly isn’t the case anymore.

In November last year, Japanese electronics conglomerate Sony sold all its shares in Sony Electronics Huanan, a Guangzhou factory that makes consumer electronics, and British high-street retailer Marks & Spencer announced it was closing all its China stores amid continuing China losses.

Add to that list Metro AG, Home Depot, Best Buy, Revlon and L’Oreal; and we start to see more than a trend developing.

Once considered Beijing’s most-welcomed guests, bringing with them the money, management skills, and technical knowledge that the country so badly needed, foreign companies now appear to have fallen out of favour.

“China doesn’t need foreign companies so badly now in terms of acquiring advanced technology and capital as in previous years,” said Professor Chong Tai-Leung from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, “so of course, the government is likely to gradually phase out more of these preferential policies for foreign firms.”

Echoing Chong’s comments, Shen Danyang, a spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Commerce accused some foreign corporates last September of only wanting to make “quick money”, had become too dependent on preferential government policies in China, and were starting to feel the pain of what he called a “deteriorating environment for business” in the country.

But for those who had “insight and courage”, Shen insisted China is still a good place to invest.

We are seeing more Chinese companies becoming champions in other countries, and of course that adds a lot of pressure on foreign corporates

While it’s still open to discussion whether those who have now retreated from China lacked “insight and courage”, there are certainly some common factors emerging on why.

Keith Pogson, a senior partner at Ernst & Young who oversees financial services in Asia, said the major one is quite simply fierce competition from Chinese rivals.

“We are seeing more Chinese companies becoming champions in other countries, and of course that adds a lot of pressure on foreign corporates.” he said, agreeing that the gradual phasing out of preferential policies for foreign firms was certainly in China’s self-interest.

Chinese TV brands, for example, for the first time overtook their South Korean rivals last year, ranking first in global sales, with the market share of TCL – a household name in the domestic home electronics market – increasing more than 50 per cent in Northern American market in the past year.

With the rise of such home-grown firms, the Chinese authorities have been leaning towards their own “children”, said Pogson, and this gradual phasing out of preferential policies for foreign companies is likely to continue.

Preferential treatment towards foreign firms goes back to 1994 when they were included under the country’s general tax regulations.

Until 2007, firms that received foreign investment were subject to 15 per cent income tax while domestic companies paid 33 per cent tax.

But in recent years Beijing has stepped up its efforts to tighten such policies, with the new Enterprise Income Tax Law and Implementation Rules, effective since 2008 unifying the rate for domestic and foreign companies at 25 per cent.

Unclear laws and inconsistent interpretation of them have also been blamed for the flight of some foreign firms.

A survey last year by consulting firm Bain & Company and the American Chamber of Commerce in China (AmCham-China) highlighted those were the two top factors hindering foreign firms’ ability to invest and grow in China.

High labour costs and a lack of qualified employees were also among the top five challenges, the study showed.

An example of the type of regulation that is now hindering foreign progress is the new cyber security law, approved by parliament last November.

It sparked fears that foreign technology firms would be shut out and subjected to contentious requirements for security reviews, and for data to be stored on Chinese servers.

Despite more than 40 international business groups signing a petition to amend some sections of the law, the final draft approved by the parliament remained unchanged – a clear indication of Beijing’s determination to toughen its stance against foreign firms.

A quarter of the AmCham-China’s 532 member firms taking part in the survey said they had either moved or were planning to move operations out of China by the end of last year, with almost half moving to parts of “developing Asia”.

“If more overseas companies want to develop in China at this stage,” Chong said, “I would suggest they consider second- and third-tier cities.”

Berlin. Donald Trump hat bereits angekündigt, die Steuern für Unternehmen in den USA zu senken. Auch Premierministerin Theresa May droht damit, Großbritannien in eine Steueroase zu verwandeln, wenn die Austrittsverhandlungen mit der EU schlecht laufen. Die deutsche Politik setzt das unter Druck. Die Frage steht im Raum: Soll sich die Bundesregierung auf einen Steuerwettbewerb einlassen und ebenfalls die Belastung reduzieren?

Für den Wirtschaftsrat der CDU, eine einflussreiche parteinahe Vereinigung mit 11.000 Mitgliedern, ist die Sache klar: "Wir müssen ganz klare Botschaften nach Washington und London senden", sagt der Generalsekretär des Unternehmerverbands, Wolfgang Steiger, unserer Redaktion. Und die sollten lauten: "Wenn ihr die Steuern senkt, ziehen wir nach!"

EU arbeitet an einheitlicher Besteuerung

In einem Positionspapier zur Steuerpolitik, das dieser Redaktion vorliegt, spricht sich der Wirtschaftsrat sehr klar für sehr schnelle Gegenreaktionen aus. "Wenn die USA und Großbritannien einen Unterbietungswettbewerb bei den Unternehmenssteuern starten, wirft das internationale Bemühungen und Vereinbarungen über den Haufen", heißt es darin. "Aber wir müssen ihnen klar signalisieren, dass wir reagieren können und werden."

Tatsächlich verlaufen die Bemühungen auf internationaler Ebene bislang in die gegenteilige Richtung: der Steuerwettbewerb soll gebremst und Steuerschlupflöcher geschlossen werden. Die Europäische Union versucht derzeit, die Besteuerung von Unternehmen anzugleichen. Die Grundlage für die Besteuerung soll vereinheitlicht werden. Später sollen sogar Gewinne und Verluste auf europäischer Ebene verteilt werden.

Theresa May droht mit Mini-Steuersätzen

Großbritannien war bisher schon dagegen und hat jetzt, da es die EU verlassen will, ohnehin ganz andere Pläne: Sollten die Austrittsverhandlungen negativ verlaufen, werde ihre Regierung "wettbewerbsfähige" Steuersätze einführen, drohte Premierministerin May unlängst, und "die weltbesten Unternehmen und größten Investoren" anlocken.

Gemeint sind damit Steuersätze von nur noch zehn statt bisher 20 Prozent. Auch US-Präsident Trump hatte im Wahlkampf eine "Steuerrevolution" mit Sätzen von 15 Prozent verkündet. In Deutschland werden Firmengewinne bisher mit knapp 30 Prozent besteuert.

CDU-Strategen sehen Handlungsdruck

Die Beamten von Bundesfinanzminister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) denken deshalb bereits über eine Unternehmensteuerreform nach. Auch CDU-Finanzpolitiker halten sie für "ein wichtiges Projekt", schon allein wegen der EU-Pläne. Die Strategen des CDU-Wirtschaftsrats meinen aber, so lange dürfe man im Ernstfall nicht warten.

Sollten Washington oder London die Steuern senken, dürfe man nicht lange auf das Ergebnis einer Steuerreform warten, dann müsse man "zügiger mit einer Senkung der Körperschaftsteuer und der Einkommensteuer für Personenunternehmen reagieren", schreiben sie in dem Positionspapier.

Festhalten an bisheriger Haushaltspolitik

Angesichts der in den nächsten fünf Jahren zu erwartenden Steuereinnahmen von etwa 130 Milliarden Euro gebe es "einen erheblichen Spielraum für Bürger wie für Unternehmen". Haushaltsüberschüsse dürften nicht für "ein Strohfeuer zusätzlicher Wohltaten" verbrannt werden. Die bisherige Haushaltspolitik Schäubles müsse beibehalten werden.

“You know that movie ‘Drunken Master’?” he said, nodding to the cult film about a martial arts master whose secret weapon is inebriation. “It’s like that. I like to consume so much before a competition that they are literally walking me onto the mat.”

Shen, founder of a thriving startup that hawks luxury vaporizers at $450 a pop, might want to stock up for an impending match that could prove epic. His opponent? Donald Trump’s Justice Department.

Shen is among the swiftly growing ranks of marijuana entrepreneurs who could be headed for a showdown with the federal government.

The election of Trump has shocked the marijuana industry into a state of high alert at a time it had planned to be gliding into unbridled growth. Trump’s attorney general, Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, is a longtime field lieutenant in the war on drugs with unabashed hostility toward pot. It was only 10 months ago that Sessions was scolding from the dais of a Senate hearing room that the drug is dangerous, not funny and that “good people don’t smoke marijuana.”

Now he will set the direction on national drug enforcement policy at the same time that eight states, including California, have legalized recreational use of the drug. Some 60 million Americans are living in states where voters have opted to allow any adult to be able to purchase marijuana.

Business leaders like Shen are betting the rapid maturity of the cannabis industry has made it too big to jail. Even before new laws took effect permitting the recreational use of pot in the massive markets of California and Massachusetts, the legitimate pot business had dwarfed its 2011 size, when the Drug Enforcement Administration was still aggressively raiding medical marijuana vendors operating legally under state laws. Since then, President Obama’s Justice Department decreed that states should have freedom to pursue their own policies, and the legalization train seemed to have left the station.

But those who have been in the business since the early days of medical marijuana caution the legions of newcomers that federal busts and seizures could quickly make a comeback. Sessions very deliberately left that option open during his confirmation hearing.

“There are people in this administration who will crush this industry if they see the opportunity,” said Steve DeAngelo, who is considered a guru among pot entrepreneurs. DeAngelo, owner of the bustling Harborside Health Center dispensary in Oakland, was among the first in the industry and he has experienced it all: surprise raids from armed federal agents, unending lawsuits, getting locked in a jail cell. “I don’t think people who don’t have firsthand experience with the irrationality of federal intervention understand what a threat we are facing.”

But it’s hard to see much anxiety watching the comings and goings inside DeAngelo’s dispensary, which these days looks more like a Whole Foods than the shady corner bodegas such operations long resembled. Well-mannered hipsters with encyclopedic knowledge of bud patiently serve customers as sommeliers might, explaining the intricacies of abundant varietals of reefer available to be consumed in ever-evolving ways. On one side of the room is an enticing display of pot-laced baked goods, opposite that is the kind of fancy kiosk where artisan granola bars or yogurt cups might be hawked in a high-end grocery; the millennials manning this one are pitching elegantly packaged microdoses of pot injected into dried blueberries and other goodies.

DeAngelo says Trump might just let it all be, pointing to mixed signals the president sent during the campaign. But DeAngelo sees an easy legal path for Sessions and other committed anti-drug warriors in the administration, including Vice President Mike Pence, to immediately throw the industry into chaos, should they chose to do so. A survey by Marijuana Business Daily suggests many pot entrepreneurs share his concern, with 20% saying they would curb expansion plans. Many more are putting planning off until they see where the White House is going.

“Most of us are holding our breath right now,” said Emily Paxhia, co-owner of a hedge fund that invests exclusively in the cannabis industry. Lately she has been making sure that each firm in her portfolio has a Plan B in case a federal crackdown comes. Can pot growing operations, for example, shift to micro-salad greens if the feds come knocking? Can vaporizers be sold to yoga enthusiasts consuming lavender?

“We’re also starting to look at how some of the new technologies we are investing in could address needs in other countries if the U.S. becomes difficult,” Paxhia said, pointing to Canada, where she said federal embrace of recreational marijuana could open up a $22-billion market. Paxhia shared her outlook at the industrial San Francisco office space of one company in her portfolio, Meadow, which has built a digital platform through which marijuana dispensary offerings can be browsed, and products can be ordered and delivered with the ease of a service like GrubHub.

Meadow isn’t so much a pot company as a tech company, one of scores of firms that reflect the rapid integration of the marijuana industry into the broader economy.

Across the bay in Oakland, a sober-looking team at a company called CW Analytical has just spent big on sophisticated new testing equipment that allows dispensaries to quickly measure the active ingredients and purity in all the pot products they sell. The company embodies how renewed federal busts would affect not just pot growers, but an entire class of lab technicians, scientists, digital engineers, marketers and other skilled professionals.

“I would be lying if I told you it was not in the back of our minds,” said Emily Richardson, head of business development at CW. “We have been through a lot.” She said the firm lost a third of its business amid the last big round of federal raids in 2011.

Back then, Jeff Linden wasn’t even in the trade. He was running a high-end kitchen cabinet firm. Now Linden has opened a dispensary in San Francisco’s Mission District that could be mistaken for an art gallery. Condescending. Disparaging. Out of touch.

That’s how Progressive Conservative leader Patrick Brown characterized Thursday’s comments by Liberal cabinet minister Liz Sandals, in which she defended massive pay hikes for some of the province’s top public executives by slagging GO Train riding commuters.

Sandals, who made the remarks as she was leaving a Liberal cabinet meeting, brushed off questions about what average GO Train riders should think of the salary hikes, which could see some public service brass earning millions more a year.

“When you really stop and think of it, most of the people sitting on the GO train probably don’t have high-level nuclear qualifications or the business qualifications to run a multi-billion-dollar corporation,” said the treasury board president. “The talent is exceptional to be in those exceptional positions.”

Sandals comments come as outcry over the increases to Ontario Power Generation executives grows. It was revealed Thursday that OPG did not publicly consult, as was required, on the maximum salary of $3.8 million for its CEO and up to $8 million in raises for about 80 other executives.

Brown called on Sandals to apologize and blasted the Liberal government for not doing enough to address the raises as Ontarians struggle with an increasing cost of living.

“This is their culture,” he insisted. “Frankly, I don’t think they appreciate dollars and cents. I’m not surprised they’re taking this approach of being hands-off to exorbitant executive compensation.”

Brown said Sandals’ “condescending (and) disparaging” remarks demean transit riders.

He has pledged to review public sector salaries if elected in 2018. Ontarians would not be upset with “moderate” raises for public sector executives, said the Tory leader.

“I think when you’re looking at increases, an increase of 1% or 2% would have had no one offended,” he said. “But when you look at increases that are now in the range potentially of 153% that is not acceptable.”

NDP finance critic John Vanthof also slammed Sandals for her remarks.

“It’s no wonder that Ontarians are increasingly fed up with this arrogant and out-of-touch Liberal government,” he said in a statement.

Premier Kathleen Wynne said she has asked Sandals to issue a memo to all public sector employers which lay’s out the government’s “expectations” during the salary review process.

Some of the institutions have not found the right balance and in cases where employers don’t comply with the government, it will refuse salary increases, Wynne said in a statement.

A vote could come soon, with consideration by some committees and the firms’ partnerships within the next few weeks, according to a partner at one of the firms who has been involved in the talks.

By Anya George Tharakan and Jeffrey Dastin

(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc forecast an unexpected dip in operating profit for the current quarter, sending shares down more than 4 percent due to concerns about the costs of investments including new warehouses and video content.

The world's largest online retailer also reported lower-than-expected fourth-quarter revenue and missed Wall Street targets for its closely watched cloud computing unit.

The Seattle-based company is spending heavily to take greater control of its delivery systems as well as expanding its video service around the world. Key to its plan is to entice sign-ups for Amazon Prime, its $99 (79 pounds)-per-year shopping club, which has led to users buying more goods, more often.

"The story is an investment story," said Amazon Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky on a conference call with reporters, noting "stepped-up" spending levels have continued into 2017.

That pace of investment has sometimes concerned investors.

"Low cost and fast delivery are a fundamental part of Amazon’s appeal to consumers. However, they are also its Achilles' heel," said GlobalData Retail analyst Anthony Riva in a note, warning of potential "profit erosion" this year.

Sales in the first quarter will have a tough comparison to the year prior, he added, when foreign exchange rates were more favorable and the Feb. 29 leap day gave shoppers an extra 24 hours to spend.

The just-ended holiday season was Amazon's best-ever, the company has said. It was a heavily promotional period for Amazon, Olsavsky said, though he did not comment on how discounts compared with prior years.

Net sales for Amazon rose 22.4 percent to $43.74 billion in the fourth quarter, compared with the average analyst estimate of $44.68 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

"Amazon's results are consistent with other e-commerce companies showing in-line or minimal upside to expectations," Baird Equity Research analyst Colin Sebastian said in a note.

Amazon is now producing television shows for Prime subscribers to watch online. It is developing gadgets with an artificially intelligent assistant, Alexa, so users can buy toilet paper and other goods by voice command. And it is building out a system of trucks, planes and warehouses so orders are sped to Prime members in two days or less, a convenience that few online retailers can afford to match.

Amazon forecast first-quarter operating income between $250 million and $900 million, below the consensus estimate of $1.34 billion, according to market research firm FactSet StreetAccount.

Amazon had reported operating income of $1.1 billion for the same period last year.

Amazon is also the market leader in the fast-growing and lucrative cloud business, selling computer services, hosting websites and storing data.

That unit, Amazon Web Services, reported a 47 percent jump in revenue to $3.54 billion, but fell short of the average analyst estimate of $3.60 billion, according to FactSet StreetAccount.

(Reporting by Anya George Tharakan in Bengaluru and Jeffrey Dastin in San Francisco; Editing by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty and Bill Rigby) A pair of Vancouver entrepreneurs hope that a crowdfunding model for buying steaks and chops will help deliver ethically raised, also known as “higher-welfare,” meat at a price that people can afford.

Meatme.co sells shares in antibiotic-free Berkshire pigs, grass-fed Black Angus heifers, pasture-raised lambs and free-range chickens from small-scale B.C. farms direct to consumers. As each animal receives full funding — from four share to about 40 shares for a large beast — it is slaughtered, butchered and home delivered.

“I started working on this about over a year ago at (business incubator) Launch Academy to see if it was feasible and fund our first cow,” said co-owner Victor Straatman. “Everyone I talked to was enthusiastic, but I was not convinced they would spend the money.”

But some did open their wallets. And to Straaman’s surprise and pleasure, most people who bought shares through the website were strangers rather than friends and neighbours.

Meatme has crowdfunded more than 15 animals to 350 customers.

Prices range from $99 for a small beef share including steaks, braising cuts, ground beef and bone broth to $250 for a full share of lamb including chops, roasts, shanks and stew meat.

Because the butchering is nose-to-tail, customers will encounter some cuts in their share that may be unfamiliar, so a certain sense of adventure is required.

“But we recently did a price comparison with stores and found our customers were saving between eight and 28 per cent,” Straaman said.

To take their business to the next level, Straatman and his partner Trevor Bird have entered the Coast Capital Savings Innovation Hub at the Sauder School of Business at UBC.

“We are going through a process to determine what our business model is going to be,” he said. “After that they will mentor us and perhaps provide some interns.”

Selling a premium product like ‘ethical’ meat is no picnic, according to heritage pig farmer Julia Smith of Urban Digs Farms. Higher welfare meat can be two to even three times as expensive as meat from animals raised in crowded barns.

“In order to have everything done to the standard we want, we essentially have to do everything ourselves,” she said.

In practice, that means raising the animals on spacious pasture, diverting quality feed from the waste stream, taking the butchering of the animals in house, marketing, packaging and delivering the product themselves.

And five years in — with considerable support from the media following new agrarian and slow meat movements — Smith and her partner Ludo Ferrari at Urban Digs have yet to turn a profit.

“We are getting there, because once people try the product they really don’t go back,” she said. “But the base of people who share our values and who can afford to support it is a small one.”

“I think we will make money this year, but whatever, we are in this for the long haul,” she said.

rshore@postmedia.com The Budget is commendable because it lives up to the words of the father of nation. (Source: IE)

It was Mahatma Gandhi who said that India lives in its villages. India’s prosperity wouldn’t be complete till its hinterlands grow and fruits of development reach the last man standing. The Budget is commendable because it lives up to the words of the father of nation. The government had to balance the socio-economic growth agenda, digital connectivity, enlarging tax base and easing the process of doing business.

This Budget is largely people-centric; it provides impetus for growth and income generation at the grass-root level where the real Bharat exists. The finance minister has made a strong attempt to pump capital into the rural economy and the infrastructure sector. This is bound to yield dividends, and I believe it will give a multiplier effect with demand generation and employment creation over time across whole of India because of the spur in the rural economy.

The Budget comes at a time when the world’s economy is facing headwinds of protectionism. The International Monetary Fund estimates the advanced economies to grow in the range of 1.6-1.9% and emerging economies between 4.1-4.5%. The Indian economy continues to be a bright spot in the global scenario. The measures announced in the Budget will accelerate the growth momentum, and place the country in the 8-10% growth trajectory.

You may also like to watch:

Demonetisation has increased the capacity of banks to lend at reduced interest rates and this will create a low interest environment and bring down the cost of capital, boosting private investment.

The emphasis on affordable housing and providing it the infrastructure status will drive growth. This push will have a positive impact not just in core construction sectors like steel and cement but also in lending business of banks and NBFCs and credit takeoff will improve, which is the need of the hour.

The important take away from the Budget is the government’s decision to contain fiscal deficit at 3.2% of GDP in fiscal 2018. This will not only reduce the net borrowing, but also give a positive impact on interest rates. The tax cut for MSMEs with a turnover of R50 crore is a positive move too. The abolition of Foreign Investment Promotion Board is a step in the right direction to improve the ease of doing business.

The proposal to make political funding transparent is an important step as it leads to better and accountable governance. I am happy to see that the Budget has announced significant steps in that direction.

The initiative to include the Railway Budget into the Union Budget is a welcome move. The idea to feed about 7,000 railway stations with solar power in the medium term is worth appreciation.

Massive investment in infrastructure will boost the performance of the automotive sector. Host of small and medium enterprises, will have more funds to invest, with the reduction of corporate tax to 25%. Lubricant sector will also get a boost due to the fillip given to construction and road infra segment.

From a healthcare perspective, it is good to hear that the FM wants to encourage private sector participation in medical education. I was hopeful that healthcare would be accorded the infrastructure status.

The heart of government’s endeavour lies in digitalising the Indian economy. To that extent, focus is on growing the digital footprint in the country — enhancing digital infrastructure, capping cash transactions, reducing cash donations, using Aadhaar Pay to enable more digital payments. All these measures would give options to every man and woman in hinterland. It could truly transform India.

Chairman, Hinduja Group of Companies (India) Spin Cycle News, views and commentary on Long Island, state and national politics.

The head of Long Island’s largest business organization is asking Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s economic development czar for assistance in helping lure the New York Islanders back to the renovated Nassau Coliseum.

In a letter Thursday to Howard Zemsky, head of the Empire State Development, Kevin Law, president of the Long Island Association, said the state could help make the Coliseum, more “attractive” to Islanders ownership.

For example, the state could fund a bus rapid transit system to connect the Coliseum to the Mineola and Hempstead Long Island Rail Road stations, or provide grants and tax credits to expand the size of the arena. The state is already investing in a parking garage and a bio-tech park around the Coliseum.

A spokeswoman for the agency said it is reviewing the letter.

The remodeled Coliseum will have 13,000 seats for hockey, but county officials say the building could be retrofitted to add back 2,000 seats.

Brooklyn Sports & Entertainment, the entity spending $130 million to renovate the Coliseum, declined to comment.

Law also discouraged Zemsky from funding an arena at state-run Belmont Park.

“It makes no sense to support construction of an arena less than 10 miles from the new Coliseum,” Law wrote. “The New York Islanders belong in one place — the Nassau Coliseum.”

Newsday reported that Islanders owners have had discussions about building a new arena next to Citi Field in Flushing or at Belmont in Elmont.

The letter comes after Newsday reported Monday that Nassau County Executive Edward Mangano met in November with Islanders owner Jonathan Ledecky to discuss the team’s return to the Coliseum.

Management of the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, where the Islanders have played the past two seasons, are encouraging the Islanders to opt out of its 25-year license agreement with the arena and move back to the Coliseum, according to sources familiar with the conversations.

The team and Barclays Center each have the ability to opt out of the deal in January 2018. id

https://about.coursera.org/united-states-of-knowledge Snap Inc. plans to spend $2 billion with Alphabet Inc. over the next five years to use Google’s cloud-computing services, according to Snap’s initial public offering filing. The social media firm also listed its dependency on Google as a key risk investors should consider before buying stock.

Snap, owner of the Snapchat mobile app, said it relies on Google’s services for the "vast majority" of its computing, bandwidth and data-storage needs. "Any disruption of or interference with our use of the Google Cloud operation would negatively affect our operations and seriously harm our business," the company wrote in the filing on Thursday.

The two companies signed an agreement in January for the five-year deal. Under the terms, Snap is required to spend at least $400 million a year on Google cloud services. A portion of these payments can be delayed, during the first four years of the deal. In return for this commitment, Snap said it will get discounted pricing from Google, without being more specific.

The deal is a big win for Google’s cloud division, which under Diane Greene, is trying to catch leaders Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. Snap was an early customers of Google’s cloud services, and the social media company remains one of its largest spenders, people familiar with the companies have said.

Varnish cache server Visa, the world’s largest payments network operator, has reported $2.1 billion net income for the quarter ended December 31, 2016, a rise of 7 per cent over the prior year’s results due to higher payments growth and cross-border volumes.



Payments volume growth, on a constant dollar basis, for the three months ended Dec 31 was 39 per cent over the prior year at $1.8 trillion. Cross-border volume growth was 140 per cent for quarter.



Net operating revenue in the fiscal first quarter of 2017 was $4.5 billion, an increase of 25 per cent, driven by the inclusion of Europe and continued growth in processed transactions and nominal payments volume. Exchange rate shifts versus the prior year negatively impacted reported net operating revenue growth by approximately 3 percentage points.



“Visa’s fiscal 2017 is off to a terrific start with a strong first quarter of revenue and earnings growth driven by accelerating growth in payments volume, cross-border commerce and processed transactions in virtually all regions around the world,” said Alfred F Kelly, Jr, chief executive officer of Visa Inc.



“As we look ahead, we continue to see good momentum in the business driven by domestic and cross-border volumes, increasing consumer participation in electronic payments in developing markets, and the further acceleration of e-commerce in developed markets.



“We remain focused on the integration of Europe which is proceeding well,” he added.

Looking ahead, Visa affirmed its financial outlook for fiscal 2017 and annual net revenue growth is expected in the range of 16 per cent to 18 per cent on a nominal dollar basis. – TradeArabia News Service  O governo federal prepara a criação da faixa 4 do programa habitacional Minha Casa Minha Vida (MCMV), destinado a famílias com renda mensal de até R$ 9 mil, conforme apurou o Broadcast, sistema de notícias em tempo real do Grupo Estado, com fontes próximas do assunto. Hoje, o limite é de R$ 6,5 mil.



Os beneficiários deste novo segmento poderão comprar imóveis de até R$ 300 mil, utilizando financiamento com recursos originados no Fundo de Garantia do Tempo de Serviço (FGTS) a juros anuais de 9,16%. Essa taxa é maior do que nas outras faixas do MCMV, que chegam a 8,16% ao ano. Entretanto, é mais atrativa do que os valores cobrados pelos bancos fora do programa, que vão de 10% a 14% ao ano.



A medida será anunciada na segunda-feira, 6, durante cerimônia às 15h30, em Brasília, com a participação do presidente, Michel Temer, além de ministros e empresários.



Outra novidade será a correção nos limites de renda nas demais faixas do programa em cerca de 6,5%, visando acompanhar a inflação. Com isso, a renda mensal máxima das famílias para enquadramento na faixa 1,5 deve subir de R$ 2,3 mil para aproximadamente R$ 2,6 mil; na faixa 2 de R$ 3,6 mil para R$ 3,9 mil; e na faixa 3 de R$ 6,5 mil para R$ 7,0 mil.



Esses números ainda estão sendo ajustados e arredondados pelo governo federal, podendo ter algumas alterações no anúncio de segunda-feira. Também não está confirmada se a correção abrangerá a faixa 1, válido para famílias com renda de até R$ 1 8 mil. Neste segmento, o imóvel é praticamente todo pago com dinheiro do Tesouro Nacional, ao contrário das demais faixas, que usam recursos do FGTS e do FAR.



O governo federal também subirá em 10% o preço máximo dos imóveis contratados pelo programa habitacional nas faixas 2 e 3. Dessa forma, os valores passarão de R$ 225 mil para R$ 250 mil nas regiões metropolitanas de São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro e Distrito Federal. A última alteração nas faixas de renda e preços dos imóveis do Minha Casa Minha Vida ocorreu em outubro de 2015, ainda durante o governo da ex-presidente Dilma Rousseff.



As reformas no MCMV atendem a reivindicações de empresários do setor da construção. Os representantes dos principais sindicatos e associações reclamam que os valores dos imóveis no programa estão defasados, o que inviabiliza a realização de novos projetos nas cidades onde os terrenos são mais valorizados, como nas regiões metropolitanas.



Além disso, a aceitação de mais famílias dentro do MCMV ajuda a aliviar a crise no mercado imobiliário. Fora do programa, o financiamento para compra de moradias é mais caro, o que se tornou um dos principais responsáveis por esfriar as vendas de casas e apartamentos, bem como gerar distratos.



Estoques



O governo federal ainda estuda dar um empurrão nas vendas dos estoques das incorporadoras. Para isso, cogita aumentar o valor máximo dos imóveis que podem ser financiados com recursos do FGTS no mercado. O limite atual de R$ 950 mil, válido para São Paulo, Rio e Brasília, pode ir para um patamar entre R$ 1,2 milhão ou R$ 1,5 milhão.



Essa medida, porém, seria restrita para a compra de imóveis prontos no estoque das incorporadoras. Portanto, não incluiria unidades usadas, nas mãos de pessoas físicas. Além disso, permaneceria válida até serem liberados R$ 500 milhões do fundo. Depois disso, voltaria a valer o teto anterior, de R$ 950 mil.



 Desde a chegada dos dois voos já em operação o número de argentinos que visitam o estado só cresce. Foto: Setur-PE/Divulgação

Voo com destino à Argentina ganha mais uma linha aérea partindo de Recife. A Gol Linhas Aéreas Inteligentes lançou nesta quinta-feira mais uma operação, que terá início em 1º de maio, com saída nas segundas-feiras, às 23h15, e chegada às 4h50 da terça-feira no local. A nova frequência tem sido bem aceita pelos argentinos, que assumiram a liderança no ranking dos destinos emissores internacionais para Pernambuco.Segundo o Secretário de Turismo, Esportes e Lazer do Estado, Felipe Carreras, a ideia é aumentar ainda mais esses números de visitantes. Desde a chegada dos dois voos já em operação, um pela própria empresa Gol e outra pela Latam, o número de argentinos que visitam o estado só cresce. Em 2014, foram cerca de 18,5 mil turistas do país, mantendo o crescimento em 2015, com 29,3 mil e em 2016, com 51,6 mil visitantes.Atualmente, Pernambuco conta com voos diretos para Portugal (TAP), Cabo Verde (TACV), Panamá (Copa Airlines), Estados Unidos (American Airlines e Azul), Alemanha (Condor), Uruguai (Gol), Argentina (Gol e TAM) e Itália (Meridiana). Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock plunged more than 30 points in after-hours trading Thursday after the company announced fiscal results for its fourth-quarter ended Dec. 31, 2016.

In its quarterly report, the e-commerce giant said it earned $1.54 per share, well above the $1.42 per share analysts were expecting. Revenue rose 22.4% year-over-year (y/y) to $43.74 billion driven by strong sales in the holiday period and a jump in subscriptions for Amazon Prime service.

Amazon said last month that the 2016 holiday was its best-ever shopping season. That said however, the number came in nearly $1 billion below Street views for $44.7 billion.

Meanwhile, revenue in Amazon web services, the company’s cloud computing business, rose by 47%, y/y, to $3.54 billion.

“With millions of active customers, AWS continues to grow, and enterprise customers have committed to migrating tens of thousands of applications to AWS,” the company said in a statement.

While the AWS results looked strong, the figure comes in below analyst expectations for 3.6 billion for the division, so a miss as well.

Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos did not address the revenue miss in his co.’s press release about the results Thursday afternoon, instead highlighting customers’ “obsession” with the company’s “Amazon Prime” member service. He noted that the “Prime Video” streaming offering “is now available in more than 200 countries and territories…Tens of millions of new paid members joined the program in just this past year.”

For the current quarter, the Seattle-based online retailer guided Q117 revenues of $33.25 billion to 35.75 billion, as compared to analysts’ expectations of $36 billion. It cited foreign exchange effects of about $730 million or 250 basis points.

Amazon Stock Action/Valuation

Amazon stock is down $35.28 to $804.67 in after-hours trading today. It closed Thursday’s trading session at $839.95, up nearly 8 points, or 0.91%, on the Nas. Approximately 7 million shares changed hands during regular hours, compared to the stock’s average daily volume of 4.06 million shares.

On valuation-measures, shares of Amazon.com, Inc. have a trailing-12 and forward P/E of 192.43 and 97.44, respectively. P/E to growth ratio is 4.85, while t-12 profit margin is 1.64%. EPS registers at $4.37. The company has a market cap of about $399 billion and a median Street price target of $945 with a high target of $1,250.00.

On trading-measure, AMZN has a beta of 1.43 and a short float of 5.8 million. In the past 52 weeks, AMZN shares have traded between a low of $474.00 and a high of $847.21, with 50-day moving average (MA) and 200-day MA located at $792.83 and $782.24 levels, respectively.

Così il ministro per lo Sviluppo economico, Carlo Calenda, durante il Question time alla Camera sugli investimenti di Enel e Terna destinati alla rete elettrica in Abruzzo, anche alla luce della recente emergenza connessa al nuovo sciame sismico e alle eccezionali precipitazioni nevose.

«Sono stati acquisiti i primi dati relativi agli investimenti sulle reti delle aree interessate dai disservizi - ha aggiunto -. Enel ha comunicato di aver investito nel biennio 2015-16 circa 87 milioni di euro, di cui 43 nel 2016, in particolare sulla rete di media tensione e di aver programmato nel prossimo biennio 90 milioni di euro di nuovi investimenti. Terna ha invece comunicato di aver investito circa 200 milioni negli anni 2015 e 2016».

«Ai concessionari del servizio elettrico sarà richiesto di rivedere i piani di intervento e di ammodernamento delle reti sulla base di parametri tecnici che consentano di fronteggiare situazioni meteorologiche finora ritenute del tutto anomalo e di avere capacità di resistenza anche in condizioni eccezionali», ha proseguito Calenda. Condizioni, ha poi notato, che «purtroppo oggi non sono più da considerare sempre eccezionali».

Il ministro rispondeva a una interrogazione del deputato abruzzese di Scelta Civica Giulio Cesare Sottanelli che notava come «i recenti disservizi hanno fatto emergere nuovamente la totale inadeguatezza della rete infrastrutturale abruzzese e, quindi, la mancanza di adeguati investimenti per la modernizzazione e il rafforzamento della rete».

Sulla quale intanto si sta lavorando.L’emergenza elettrica infatti è finita, ma le squadre di e-distribuzione, società del gruppo Enel che gestisce le reti elettriche di media e bassa tensione, nei territori abruzzesi colpiti dall’eccezionale ondata di maltempo. Sono 1600, da sapere la società elettrica, le persone ancora al lavoro in più di 100 cantieri per completare la riparazione delle linee elettriche danneggiate.

L’operazione di questi giorni consentirà di ricollegare alla rete i clienti attualmente serviti attraverso i gruppi elettrogeni, che potranno così essere man mano rimossi.

Dopo un picco di ben 1.000 generatori dispiegati sul campo, il numero di gruppi ancora attivi in Abruzzo è sceso ora a 120, grazie all'avanzamento dei lavori di riparazione.

Intanto per oggi è stato convocato il consiglio dei ministri che dovrebbe varare il decreto per le aree colpite dal sisma. In questo decreto potrebbero essere inserite le misure per i danni indiretti alle imprese. Ieri a tarda sera si è svolto un vertice per lo studio delle misure pr i territori colpiti dal terremoto e dal maltempo e per le imprese che chiedono il ristoro dei danni indiretti, legati al blocco dell’attività.

Tra le misure allo studio si pensa anche a una zona franca

per i 134 comuni (tra cui 14 abruzzesi) inseriti nel decreto terremoto. La misura è destinata a circa 67 mila imprese industriali, artigiane, commerciali.

Si tratta di un credito d’imposta che consentirà alle imprese di scontare Irap, Ires, Iva, Irpef.

©RIPRODUZIONE RISERVATA Tagli alle tasse e agevolazioni contributive e previdenziali. È quanto prevede in sintesi il pacchetto d'interventi proposti dal sindaco Maurizio Brucchi (nella foto) al governo, in vista del varo del "decreto Abruzzo" previsto oggi, per affrontare l'emergenza sul territorio teramano. Il primo cittadino, in una lettera indirizzata al premier Gentiloni e al capo dello Stato Sergio Mattarella, descrive la situazione drammatica creata per famiglie e imprese dalle ripetute scosse sismiche tra agosto e metà gennaio e dal maltempo. Nell'elenco ci sono le 668 ordinanze di sgombero, i quasi duemila sfollati, i mille studenti sfrattati dal sisma e le 50 attività produttive danneggiate. Per questo il sindaco sollecita la sospensione dei versamenti contributivi e previdenziali per dipendenti e lavoratori autonomi, incentivi per le assunzioni e bonus per le aziende che trasformano i contratti a tempo determinato in definitivi, nonché contributi per la ricostruzione di stalle e capannoni di imprese agricole. Stanziamenti ulteriori, nella proposta di Brucchi, vanno destinati alla localizzazione di nuove imprese nel territorio del cratere e per la ricostruzione degli stabilimenti lesionati a cui si dovrebbero

aggiungere finanziamenti a tasso zero fino a un massimo di 50 milioni di euro per investimenti. Il sindaco sollecita anche la sospensione dei versamenti e il rinvio al 30 aprile della scadenza per le dichiarazioni Iva e lo slittamento al 31 ottobre delle dichiarazioni dei redditi. (g.d.m.) TERAMO. La Camera di commercio istituisce un tavolo di coordinamento per individuare gli strumenti per compensare le imprese dei danni subiti in occasione dell’eccezionale nevicata e delle ultime scosse di terremoto.

Il tavolo sarà coordinato dal presidente Gloriano Lanciotti e sarà composto da un rappresentante di ciascuna associazione di categoria presente in consiglio, dal rappresentante dei sindacati, dei consumatori e delle professioni, da un rappresentante della Regione, della Provincia, del Comune di Teramo nonché dell'Ufficio territoriale della ricostruzione, che avrà il compito di individuare le più appropriate strategie di intervento a sostegno delle attività economiche e di tutti i soggetti residenti in provincia. L’organismo sarà soggetto di riferimento nei confronti del commissario straordinario per la ricostruzione e del vice .

«Nell'immediato sarà presentata una mozione al commissario straordinario per la ricostruzione, al fine di chiedere il posticipo della scadenza dei termini per la presentazione delle domande di sopralluogo sulle abitazioni e sulle attività produttive e la proroga dei termini degli adempimenti fiscali e delle scadenze programmate. Nello stesso contesto, saranno valutate le opportune forme di rivalsa nei confronti di Enel e Terna a favore delle imprese della provincia di Teramo per i disagi e i danni causati dalla perdurante mancanza di energia elettrica», si legge in una nota dell’ente.

«Il sistema delle imprese esce da questa emergenza con le ossa rotte, la gravità dei danni ancora non si riesce a diagnosticare», esordisce Lanciotti, «una delle criticità maggiori per le imprese è stata la prolungata e ingiustificata mancanza di energia elettrica; una situazione simile, per durata ed estensione territoriale, non è riscontrabile in Italia almeno negli ultimi decenni. A ciò si aggiungono i danni provocati, in alcuni ambiti territoriali, dal riallaccio dell'energia con voltaggi non adeguati che hanno comportato guasti a impianti, macchinari, attrezzature d'ufficio. Gli eventi calamitosi hanno determinato danni diretti alle attività economiche, per i quali occorrerà sensibilizzare il governo regionale e nazionale affinché vengano individuati gli strumenti adeguati per compensare le imprese dei danni subiti, anche ad esempio attraverso l'utilizzo degli stessi regimi di intervento previsti dai due decreti legge (189 e 205) emanati dal governo a seguito del sisma del 24 agosto e del 30 ottobre».

Ma Lanciotti fa notare che forse gli effetti indiretti saranno addirittura peggiori. «Le attività agricole e zootecniche sono in ginocchio; oltre ai danni fisici subiti dalle aziende, si registra la perdita totale delle produzioni nei campi che significa azzeramento del fatturato», fa notare il presidente, «gli allevamenti hanno subito perdite ingenti. Il turismo e le attività collegate registrano il totale azzeramento dei livelli di attività, già pesantemente compromessi dopo il terremoto del 24 agosto. Particolarmente penalizzato l'entroterra, in quanto individuato come territorio non sicuro per via della vicinanza con gli epicentri del sisma. Questa visione negativa del territorio, dovuta alla percezione di insicurezza e di pericolo, "contagia" anche il turismo balneare come rilevano gli operatori del settore sulla base dell'andamento delle prenotazioni e del decrescente interesse dei tour operator e dei clienti verso le nostre mete».Effetti negativi anche su artigianato e commercio. «Caso emblematico, ma non unico, il distretto ceramico di Castelli messo in ginocchio dal sisma, ora ancor più penalizzato dalle nevicate», fa notare Lanciotti che sottolinea anche come per il commercio i saldi – importante fonte di guadagno dopo un andamento stentato delle vendite di Natale – non siano partiti a causa della nevicata. Senza contare che dall’entroterra parte della popolazione si è spostata verso la costa. Non a caso il presidente fa notare come nel capoluogo «i segnali di una progressiva marginalizzazione economica e commerciale

sono sempre più evidenti». Parole da cui emerge preoccupazione per «una situazione densa di difficoltà e incognite che necessita di essere affrontata con strumenti straordinari e con una governance condivisa tra tutti gli attori del sistema economico locale».

©RIPRODUZIONE RISERVATA Funeral services are expensive; so it'd be wise for families to start arrangements even when everyone is healthy.

KUALA LUMPUR: With the price of funerals easily running into the thousands of ringgit, several service providers have advised families against waiting until the final hour to plan their arrangements.

“People should do their homework and put aside money for funerals,” said Casket Paradise Funeral Care director Peter Lee in an interview with FMT.

Lee, who has been in the business for more than 30 years, said many people made the mistake of not planning for the eventuality.

“The problem is that many people avoid the topic,” he said. “When a loved one dies, they panic. They then opt for the first available option. If the service does not meet their expectations, they get upset and regret it.”

Lee said a basic funeral package would now cost at least RM6,000. Such a package would include a simple casket, a funeral set-up, tents, tables, chairs and water for the guests and labour charges.

Ten years ago, the same package would cost about RM4,000, he said.

For Buddhist or Taoist funerals, the price could be as high as RM10,000 for a basic package. The price varies according to the number of days for mourning and the choice of dialect for the prayers to be conducted in.

“For Teochew funerals, just the cost of getting the priests to chant prayers can be more than RM3,000 per night,” said Lee.

He said basic packages would not include the provision of food, a funeral music band and a burial plot or cremation and a place in a columbarium.

“In the Klang Valley, there is hardly any land left for affordable burial plots. So many people have turned to private memorial parks because only private memorial parks have land banks now.

“Some Chinese clan associations have land, but you must be a member of the association or living in the area to be buried there.”

He said private memorial parks could charge as high as RM20,000 for a burial plot while a columbarium lot could cost RM5,000 or more.

He said those without enough money for a loved one’s funeral would often turn to various associations or the Welfare Department for help.

“Sometimes, these associations or the Welfare Department will reach out to us to help with funeral arrangements. In such cases, we will do a simple one for free.”

A spokesman for a leading funeral parlour in Kota Kinabalu told FMT that the charges for its cremation services would start from RM4,888 and its burial services from RM5,888. A spot in its columbarium would cost at least RM2,000.

Charges for burial services do not cover the burial plot, which in KK would cost at least RM3,000.

An official at My Khairat, a Muslim funeral services provider, said a Muslim funeral in the Klang Valley would cost between RM1,000 and RM1,500, depending on the location and type of hearse.

Farhana Mohd Noor, the company’s marketing manager, said the price would include a burial plot on wakaf grounds.

She said the company had a number of packages, including family packages – for burial arrangements for the entire family – and prepaid plans so that one would not need to make a lump sum payment. .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... ..........

Alaska on Thursday rejected a proposal to make it the first state in the nation allowing consumption of marijuana in retail pot stores. Recreational marijuana is legal in another seven states and the District of Colombia.

Here is where each of those states stand with pot consumption at places where marijuana is sold:

___

CALIFORNIA

California state law leaves the question of onsite consumption to local governments. Lori Ajax, the state’s top marijuana regulator, said in an email that restrictions include that access to the area where cannabis use is allowed be limited to people only 21 and over, consumption cannot be visible to the general public and the sale or consumption of alcohol or tobacco is not allowed on the premises.

___

COLORADO

Colorado does not allow onsite consumption at retail stores, though some private clubs operate around the state. The city of Denver has started discussing how to go about licensing marijuana social clubs after voters approved that in November. How it’s allowed to be consumed — whether by smoking, vaping or via edibles — varies. Regulations prohibiting smoking in interior public spaces have greatly restricted smoking it. In general, customers aren’t allowed to consume marijuana where they bought it.

__

DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA

There are no retail marijuana stores in the District of Columbia. While possession of up to 2 ounces of pot is legal, the city was barred by Congress from taxing the drug or legalizing sales. Pot advocates argued that there was room in the city’s initiative legalizing marijuana to allow consumption at private clubs. But Democratic Mayor Muriel Bowser opposed the idea, and the D.C. Council narrowly voted to ban pot clubs last year.

MAINE

Maine’s law, approved by voters in November, includes a provision for the licensing retail marijuana social clubs. These businesses would sell marijuana to be consumed on the premises. It could not be taken away. Maine’s state government is at the beginning of the long process of drafting rules that would govern the clubs, and other facets of retail marijuana. The state has about a year to implement rules. No clubs can open before rules are in place.

__

MASSACHUSETTS

The voter-approved Massachusetts law permits onsite consumption of marijuana only if the city or town where the retail store is located votes, by referendum, to allow it. So absent an affirmative vote of the local community, onsite consumption at pot shops is prohibited. Retail pot shops are not expected to be licensed and open for business in Massachusetts until mid-2018.

__

NEVADA

Pot could be allowed at Nevada casinos, clubs, outdoor events, massage parlors and other public places under legislation proposed this year by a Las Vegas Democrat. Nevada Sen. Tick Segerblom is challenging state laws banning marijuana from public places or in pot shops with a bill that would give local governments the discretion to license public use. That would be big business, Segerblom said. Nevada is one of the few remaining states where tobacco is allowed in most public places, including casinos and bars. “We’re going to be advertising around the world ‘Come to Nevada to use legal pot,'” Segerblom said. “We can’t invite them to come here then tell them they can’t use it.”

OREGON

Oregon state law prohibits the use of marijuana in retail stores. The law also bans the use of marijuana in public places. They are defined as any place with public access — including establishments with liquor licenses, apartment building lobbies, parks, playgrounds and public transportation stations.

__

WASHINGTON STATE

Washington state bans pot consumption or even opening packages of marijuana at retail stores. Washington’s law does not allow for cannabis lounges, but the state’s most high-profile lobby for the industry, the Washington CannaBusiness Association, has made legalization of pot lounges a legislative priority this year. “Community norms when it comes to the use of cannabis differ across the state,” the organization wrote on its website. “WACA will support legislation allowing local control of ordinances that would create rules regulating consumption lounges for adults over the age of 21.”

(Reuters) - Shares in discount brokerages TD Ameritrade <AMTD.O>, E*Trade <ETFC.O> and Charles Schwab <SCHW.N> fell as investors bet Schwab's slashing of trading commissions would be the start of a price war.

Schwab announced earlier on Thursday that it would reduce its online equity and ETF trade commissions to $6.95 from $8.95 and claimed to have the lowest commission among competitors.

Shares in TD Ameritrade were hit the hardest as it derives about 42 percent of revenue from trading fees, the biggest exposure of the three companies.

Its shares fell as much as 11 percent and were last down 9.3 percent at $41.79, on track for its biggest one-day percentage decline since Dec. 2008. Trading volume was 7.5 times the 10-day moving average.

"You're going to continue to see downward pricing pressure on transaction-based business," Matt Lynch, Managing Partner at Strategy & Resources LLC in Dayton, Ohio. "Throughout the industry I think there's a heightened sensitivity to those fees."

TD Ameritrade Chief Executive Tim Hockey told CNBC that he was not surprised by the Charles Schwab price move and that he would look and see what his company would do.

"We think it's much more around the tools, the capabilities and the experiences," Hockey said.

Shares in E*Trade fell 9.7 percent to $33.97 after hitting a low of $33.33 earlier in the session. It was on track for its biggest one-day decline since June. Trading volume for E*Trade was 4 times its 10-day moving average.

Schwab, which derives about 11 percent of its revenue from trading fees, saw its shares fall 4.9 percent at $39.33. Trading volume for Schwab was twice its 10-day moving average.

William Katz, analyst at Citigroup, said in a research note that the move "raises commoditization risks for the online trading model as it could lead to a further round of price cuts."





(Additional reporting By Elizabeth Dilts in New York; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama) The Calgary International Airport has joined forces with two other major Canadian airports to warn of the potential dangers of privatization.



Together with the Ottawa and Vancouver international airports, YYC has created a website — www.noairportselloff.ca — to argue against selling Canadian airports to private investors, an idea that is currently being studied by the Trudeau government. Currently, Canada's major airports are owned by the federal government and run by non-profit airport authorities, but some observers — including former cabinet minister David Emerson in his recent review of Canada's transportation system — have called for privatization as a way to improve Canadian air travel competitiveness.



With the launch of the website, YYC and its partners are fighting back, arguing that selling the country's airports to for-profit investors would increase travel costs for passengers, remove local voices from airport boards, and undermine the Canadian economy.



"Airport authorities re-invest every penny earned back into our airports and that investment has created some of the best airport facilities in the world," said Bob Sartor, president and CEO of the Calgary Airport Authority, in a release. "We are launching this campaign to educate Canadians about the impacts to travellers and local communities if the federal government proceeds with selling the country's airports."



Canada's major airports do not receive any funding from the federal government. Instead, the airport authorities pay rent to the government — to the tune of $1 billion a year. (The Calgary Airport Authority alone paid $520 million in federal rent from 1992 to 2015).



Critics have suggested these rents are part of the reason air travel in Canada is more expensive than in most other jurisdictions. To cover their costs — including rent — airport authorities charge fees to the airlines (including terminal fees, landing fees, and apron usage fees) which are then passed on to the consumer in the form of higher ticket prices.



The Montreal Economic Institute has suggested that if the airports were privatized, it would eliminate the rent problem and ultimately reduce the need for high fees for carriers and consumers.



However, airport authorities argue that, while their only obligation is to cover their costs and serve the community, a private operator's first duty would be to increase profits for shareholders — something that might not necessarily be in travellers' best interests.



"Canada is recognized as having the best aviation infrastructure and most efficiently-run airports in the world, and we are immensely proud of that," said Craig Richmond, president and CEO of the Vancouver Airport Authority, in a release. "Our success is due in part to the community-based, not-for-profit governance model for our airports. The current model works — for passengers and for the communities we serve."



The Trudeau government has hired investment bank Credit Suisse to investigate the pros and cons of privatizing Canadian airports. Federal Conservative leadership candidate Maxime Bernier has also spoken in favour of privatization.

Late last week, Trump signed an executive order temporarily banning travel from seven Muslim-majority countries and halting the United States’ refugee program while he “figured things out.” The normalization of extreme measures and hasty decisions is now well underway as the president doubles-down on his commitment to use the state and his authority to reshape the American and world order.

The Trump administration has clearly adopted an irrational siege mentality, the likes of which the United States has not witnessed domestically in decades. The president’s executive order was immediately condemned by American politicians, rights activists, and world leaders. In the hours and days that followed, the hastily executed order sowed confusion both stateside and abroad. The White House denied targeting Muslims and even suggested the ban was going smoothly—both claims that were obviously untrue.

RELATED: Donald Trump invites authoritarianism to America

In response to backlash against the order, Trump’s press secretary, Sean Spicer, denied that the Muslim ban was indeed a “Muslim” “ban,” despite the fact that the executive order banned certain Muslims from entering the United States and that Trump himself had used the word “ban” in reference to it (and later tweeted that critics can “call it what they want”).

In another Orwellian moment worthy of “We’ve always been at war with Eurasia Eastasia,” the White House blamed the media. Naturally. Trump was merely repeating the word used so frequently by the administration’s most nefarious enemy, the press, Spicer claimed.

Under normal circumstances, travel bans or restrictions are policy tools that countries use to manage risk during uncertain times. In 2011, President Barack Obama temporarily slowed the admission of Iraqi refugees after discovering that two individuals—out of tens of thousands—who had fled Iraq were arrested in the U.S. on terrorism charges. After the arrests, the Obama administration revetted 58,000 Iraqi refugees and introduced stricter screening procedures for Iraqi nationals entering the country. As a result, the rate of refugee arrivals from Iraq declined in 2011 against 2010 numbers, but then rose in 2012.

MORE: The disturbing parallels between Trump and Putin

Trump’s ban is wildly more impulsive and far-reaching than Obama’s quite limited 2011 measures. The ban is hasty and somehow both sweeping and incomprehensive. The president chose to sign the executive order his first week—indicating that the need for the order was immediate. There was no time to wait. The clock was ticking. Like an episode of 24.

As far as anyone can tell, there is no immediate threat to the United States that necessitates such an order. As David Bier, an immigration policy analyst at the Cato Institute—a conservative, libertarian think-tank founded by Charles Koch, of Koch brothers fame—pointed out:

“The order would ban all people entering the United States from Iraq, Iran, Syria, Somalia, Sudan, Libya, and Yemen, and yet no terrorist from these places has carried out a lethal attack in the United States. Indeed, no Libyans or Syrians have even been convicted for planning such an attack. Moreover, the likelihood of being killed by any refugee from any country is just 1 in 3.64 billion a year. This discrimination is arbitrary and cannot be rationally justified based on a[sic] assessment of the risk.”

Left off the ban list are countries where Trump has done business. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Egypt were not included in the seven countries targeted. As the New York Times reports, “…these three countries have exported terror to the United States in the past. They accounted for 18 of the 19 terrorists who perpetrated the Sept. 11 attack … These countries, unlike those subject to the ban, are ones where Donald Trump has done business.”

In instituting this ban, Trump is trying to look strong and decisive on security without doing the difficult work of developing careful, targeted policy as measures become necessary. It seems that he’s also trying to avoid risking any of his personal financial interests. I imagine the president in the White House Situation Room, pushing little toy soldier figurines around a map of the world and setting up flimsy little fences, all the while being careful not to knock over any of the garish hotel pieces that dot the map. Like a game of geopolitical Monopoly fit for a lunatic.

It is common for authoritarians to use their office to enrich themselves, their families, and their friends. Some do it through the corrupt privatization of state-owned enterprises or assets (for instance, Russia after the fall of the Soviet Union). Others craft domestic or foreign policy in the service of their personal wealth and business interests. At the very least, Trump seems to be making policy in such a way as to avoid damaging his personal financial interests.

RELATED: Trump forces the left and right to ask: What do we stand for?

The need to maintain trust and legitimacy in a democracy requires a significant degree of transparency when a leader has personal interests that intersect with his or her office. After all, to be in office is to be in a position of service to the state and the people for whom it exists. Trump has refused to be transparent about his personal interests and finances— which is unprecedented in recent American history, though it’s par for the course in authoritarian regimes.

In a sane world, not only would the leader of the free world refrain from mixing his office with his own business interests, he would also take some time to carefully develop policy based on evidence and risk assessments that balance security against rights and the basic moral imperative to treat human beings with dignity. But we’re now living in a world in which the president of the United States of America can and does make policy on the fly in a bid to frighten Americans into taking him seriously while he tries to figure out how to be a leader. We’re living in a world in which the global hegemon is testing extraordinary, unnecessary, and probably illegal security policy in real time.

In both the short and long term, the ban will have negative effects on the United States and the world. It will encourage both to be more paranoid, closed off, and hostile to those perceived as a risk—regardless of whether or not that perception is reasonable or fair. It will also encourage increased securitization while paving the way for future unreasonable and extreme measures. Why? Because the ban isn’t just a one-off act: it’s a statement about how we should think about the world.

Insofar as the ban represents a way of seeing the world, the executive order that shut America’s doors to so many, so abruptly, contributes to a state-of-war and siege mentality that sorts the world into good and evil, with a grossly inordinate emphasis on foreigners and Muslims as part of the latter. The ban encourages Americans to be afraid. Very afraid. After all, why institute an immediate, wide-ranging, emergency ban in order to “figure things out” if the threat isn’t shadowy and imminent and awfully scary?

A frightened people are a malleable people. In times of great fear, leaders must show more prudence and wisdom than usual, lest the fundamental rights, liberties, and norms that underwrite not only democracy, but also human decency, be set aside in the name of order and security.

Donald Trump does not have these capacities. Rather, he has proven himself to be predisposed to overreacting and restricting human rights as he sees fit. And those who oppose his high-handedness? Traitors and enablers of America’s enemies—such as the distinguished lawyer and civil servant Sally Yates, whom he fired as acting attorney general (from the traditionally independent Department of Justice) based on her refusal to defend the indefensible ban.

In the days and months to come, Americans must resist the temptation to give into fear by uniting around common sense and common decency; calling out cynical, xenophobic, and bigoted policy; standing in solidarity with those unfairly targeted by the ban; and demanding that American politicians and leaders around the world join in.

Many have already taken these steps. And while these actions are moral in and of themselves, there is one other reason why one might pursue them: by helping to protect others, you might just end up saving yourself.

“Esse modelo está sendo discutido e o governo federal deu seis meses para contratarmos um banco, ou alguma agência, fundação que vá fazer a modelagem e ver se ficamos com a produção de água, se vendemos distribuição”, explicou o governador Luiz Fernando Pezão, após encontro com o ministro do Supremo Tribunal Federal (STF) Edson Fachin. Não está definido se a privatização será integral ou de apenas parte das operações da companhia. O prazo pode ser prorrogado por mais seis meses.

O texto do projeto prevê que os responsáveis pela avaliação e estruturação da operação de alienação das ações da companhia serão “instituições financeiras federais”. A expectativa é que as receitas da venda sejam suficientes não só para a quitação do empréstimo de R$ 3,5 bilhões, mas também para o abatimento de outras dívidas do Estado com garantias da União.

A venda da Cedae foi condição imposta pelo governo federal na ajuda ao Rio. Pezão resistia à ideia, mas precisou colocar a empresa na mesa de negociações para conseguir benefícios como a suspensão da concessão da dívida por três anos.

O projeto que autoriza a privatização será votado pela Alerj já na semana que vem. O termo de compromisso assinado pelo Rio com a União ainda prevê que a instituição financeira que conceder o financiamento poderá indicar um representante do corpo diretor, “cujo papel será o de contribuir para o êxito da operação de alienação”.

Por enquanto, o governador trabalha para reconstruir sua base de apoio na Alerj, desgastada desde o ano passado, quando o Rio não conseguiu aprovar medidas como a elevação da alíquota previdenciária de servidores. Agora, as contrapartidas prometidas à União incluem receituário semelhante.

Pezão esteve no STF pelo terceiro dia seguido para apresentar termos do acordo e tentar convencer a Corte a antecipar cláusulas. O Rio pretende obter autorização para afastar dispositivos da Lei de Responsabilidade Fiscal que vedam a concessão de garantias a empréstimos a Estados acima do limite de endividamento. “Acredito que teremos êxito e que essa tese vai ajudar outros Estados”, disse. / COLABOROU BRENO PIRES The mayor of Parksville declined an invitation from the Island Corridor Foundation to attend a day-long roundtable in his city tomorrow (Friday, Feb. 3).

The local chamber of commerce and the tourism association didn’t even receive an invite to attend and the ICF did not notify The NEWS about the event.

“I was invited, I’m not going,” said Parkville Mayor Marc Lefebvre, who also sits on the Regional District of Nanaimo’s board of directors.

The RDN board voted last year to take back the $900,000 in taxpayer money it had committed to the ICF for the re-start of passenger rail service on Vancouver Island. The City of Parksville and the Town of Qualicum Beach stopped paying the ICF years ago for rail crossings in their communities.

The ICF has continuously said it could re-start passenger rail service on the Island for $20.9 million. It was to get the money from the regional districts and the provincial and federal governments. The RDN pulled its funding and the federal government has yet to provide money, which would trigger the province’s contribution. There are First Nations on the Island, including the Snaw-naw-as (Nanoose Bay), also supposed partners of the ICF, who have initiated lawsuits against the ICF.

Lefebvre is one of many who have consistently said there’s no way the railway could be brought to standard for passenger rail service with $21 million, even if those funds became available to the ICF. He said that’s why he is not attending the event Friday and why his city stopped paying the crossing fees to the ICF

“I still don’t believe it, so what’s he point (of attending Friday)?” said Lefebvre. “And why would I pay for fees when I’m not getting any service.”

The ICF’s office administrator said Thursday that she sent invitations to a wide list of community leaders in early January.

“I found out about it on Facebook,” said Parksville and District Chamber of Commerce CEO Kim Burden. “I don’t think we are on their A-list. We haven’t been really supportive, not because we don’t want to see rail traffic, but because we have never seen a business plan that supports it.”

Parksville Qualicum Beach Tourism Association executive director Blain Sepos also won’t be attending Friday’s event.

“I wasn't invited officially and I don't think I know of anyone else who was, other than maybe the mayor,” said Sepos.

The ICF office administrator said there will be 60 people attending the event, which runs from 9:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. at Tigh-Na-Mara. The ICF’s website calls it a “community round table” and those attending (pre-registration was required) will have to pay $30 (lunch is included).

“The event will include speakers from partnering organizations involved with the corridor foundation to provide an in-depth look of the current and future opportunities,” according to the iCF’s website.  Business is anything but usual for some of America's largest companies, as they question — or blatantly decry — President Trump's immigration ban.

Google, Amazon, Starbucks, and Facebook are just a few of the big names to have stepped forward and denounce Trump's executive order, which restricts the entry of refugees and citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries, and indefinitely bans Syrian refugees altogether.

In the latest scuffle, Apple CEO Tim Cook told the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday his company was considering taking legal action to have Trump's executive order reversed, noting that hundreds of Apple staff had been affected by the travel ban.

"More than any country in the world, this country is strong because of our immigrant background and our capacity and ability as people to welcome people from all kinds of backgrounds," Cook told the WSJ. "That's what makes us special. We ought to pause and really think deeply through that."

The following Fortune 500 companies have either publicly challenged or expressed concern over the order:

Amazon

Apple

Citigroup

Expedia

Facebook

Ford

Goldman Sachs

Alphabet

Intel

JPMorgan Chase

MasterCard

Microsoft

Netflix

Nike

Procter & Gamble

Salesforce

Twitter, Square, Airbnb, Github, Etsy, Lyft, Uber, Tesla, and TripAdvisor have also protested the ban, as have pharmaceutical companies sych as Allergan and Perlara.

Actions Speak Louder Than Words

With so many firms lending their voice to the cause, it must be asked: Is each company genuinely invested in seeing the ban dissolved because of their values — or are some brands just riding the wave of a big marketing moment?

The answer is multi-faceted: On one hand, any U.S. company speaking out against the president is taking a risk; on the other hand, it comes down to what actions these brands take beyond their statements.

"A lot of people do approve the ban, so these companies are taking a risk just by taking a stance against it," said Margaret Wolfson, founder and creative director at River + Wolf. "But there seem to be three levels involved: The first is in making a statement that brands you as a compassionate believer in American values; the second is in employers looking out for their employees so they feel protected, and the third level — the hardest of all because of the logistics it entails — is going beyond the verbal to the visceral and investing time, energy, and money."

Google, Starbucks, Lyft, and Airbnb, are among those companies putting their money where their values are, so to speak.

"We're concerned about the impact of this order and any proposals that could impose restrictions on Googlers and their families, or that could create barriers to bringing great talent to the United States," a Google spokesperson told NBC News. "We'll continue to make our views on these issues known to leaders in Washington and elsewhere."

To make its views not only known, but felt, Google created a $4 million crisis fund for those affected by the ban, pledging $2 million that can be matched by up to $2 million from employees to fund organizations such as the ACLU and the International Rescue Committee.

Starbucks announced it was developing plans to hire 10,000 refugees over five years in the 75 countries around the world where Starbucks operates. A spokesperson for the company declined to comment, instead referring to chairman and CEO Howard Schultz's public letter to Starbucks partners.

Lyft has pledged to donate $1 million to the ACLU over the next four years. A spokesperson for the company declined to comment beyond co-founder and CEO Logan Green's three tweets and Lyft's ACLU blog post.

Soon after the ban was issued, Airbnb announced that it would provide free temporary housing to refugees and others impacted by the ban.

"This initiative is a part of Airbnb's longstanding commitment to addressing the needs of refugees," said an Airbnb spokesperson, citing the company's past pledge to match up to $1 million donations to UNHCR.

Also to be noted is Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos' assertion that Amazon is prepared to support a lawsuit against Trump and his administration over the order, while Twitter's Jack Dorsey released a short film about Syrian refugee and entrepreneur Yassin Tehrou.

Thinking on a Global Level

Companies campaigning against the ban may not only be looking to protect American values, but their global relationships as well.

"A lot of organizations that have and will come out against [Trump's ban] are global firms that need support in other parts of the world," said Ronald Hill, a professor of marketing and business law at Villanova School of Business. "I wouldn't be surprised if global firms coming out against it do business in areas such as Western Europe that have high Muslim populations. You have to think from a global and not just a local perspective."

Hill anticipates that more businesses will be chiming in against the ban, particularly those that have a history of prioritizing corporate social responsibility — despite the backlash they may receive.

"Some fashion companies came out in support of people with AIDS relatively early on when there was still backlash against that," said Hill. "This is a continuation of that corporate social responsibility, but it's a new, unexplored avenue."

How the Work Pays Off

While companies embark upon this new avenue, organizations such as the ACLU are prospering more than ever.

"Historically, the ACLU doesn't get much support from companies. We're often viewed as a thorn in the government's side because we challenge them on issues," Mark Wier, chief development officer at the ACLU, told NBC News. "But we are seeing some companies create formalized gifts, and hundreds of thousands of small businesses have offered to share proceeds of sales."

From last Friday, when Trump issued the immigration ban, to the following Monday, Wier says that the ACLU raised a record $35 million.

"We've never seen that kind of outpouring so quickly," said Wier, adding that the ACLU will use the funding to hire over 100 employees including litigators, advocates, and communications specialists.

"We need to power up the grid up we've already established with more force," said Wier. "Since the ACLU was able to get a stay on that executive order in federal district court, people are really seeing that it is possible to do something — and to actually win." Cybercriminals are stealing data at an alarming rate. Both the number of breaches and the number of files stolen globally in these hacks rose dramatically to set a new record in 2016, according to a new report from Risk Based Security. The 4,149 confirmed breaches exposed more than 4.2 billion records. That's approximately 3.2 billion more records than were exposed in 2013, the previous all-time high.

Businesses were the prime targets, with more than half (55 percent) of the reported breaches. But hackers also attacked medical institutions and government agencies.

"The number of records compromised just went completely off the charts," said Inga Goddijn, executive vice president of Risk Based Security. "And as staggering as they are, our numbers probably underestimate the actual criminal activity that's taking place."

Yahoo's Mega Breaches

The big breaches at Yahoo reported last year — 500,000 records involved in one and more than a billion in the other — did drive up the numbers. But the Risk Based Security report shows that hundreds of other organizations had sizable breaches that impacted anywhere from 500,000 to more than 10 million records.

"So unfortunately, while the number of incidents doesn't really seem to be on the rise, the success of stealing or compromising large amounts of information is going up," Goddijn told NBC News.

The U.S. (1,971 incidents) and the United Kingdom (204) accounted for slightly more than half of all the reported breaches last year. Also in the top 10: Canada (119), Brazil (75), India (71), Australia (59), and Russia (49).

Breaches vary in their severity. Stealing user names and passwords or even credit card numbers is bad, but not as harmful as stealing Social Security numbers, date of birth and mother's maiden name, or sensitive medical records.

The Risk Based Security report rated breaches for severity, based on the number of records stolen, the type of information compromised and the potential fallout from the intrusion. The ten biggest breaches last year rated an average severity score of 9.96 out of 10.

"Clearly, we are not winning the war when it comes to cyber security," Goddijn said. "The criminals are enjoying a high degree of success right now."

The Hackers Are Getting Better

The non-profit Online Trust Alliance (OTA) just published its 2017 Cyber Incident & Breach Response Guide, which warns that the "cyber landscape has changed dramatically over the past 12 months," with organizations large and small being the victims of attacks that "stole, published or manipulated sensitive, personal information." These incidents include the hack attack on the Democratic National Committee and the theft of confidential medical records of world-class athletes from the Olympic Anti-Doping Agency's database.

Craig Spiezle, OTA's executive director, told NBC News that no organization or government entity is immune from today's skilled adversaries who have created highly sophisticated methods of attack.

"In the past, a lot of the breaches were opportunistic," Spiezle said. "Now we're seeing much more precision. They're targeting specific companies and industry sectors and not just for consumer data, but for business data, data regarding acquisition and mergers, data that may also harm a company's reputation."

The Problem with Social Security Numbers

Hackers were very successful last year at getting social security numbers — the master key that unlocks our lives. It's estimated that more than 19 million were compromised last year, according to a recent analysis of U.S. breaches by the Identity Theft Resource Center and CyberScout. The report noted that the number of breaches involving stolen SSNs is on the rise. More than half (52 percent) of the reported breaches included SSNs last year, up from 44 percent in 2015.

"While credit and debit card numbers can be changed, Social Security numbers cannot," noted Adam Levin, chairman and founder of CyberScout. "Hackers and identity thieves continue to evolve. They are very sophisticated, extremely creative and dogged in their pursuit of what is ours."

The ITRC/CyberScout report found that many of the corporate breaches that involve the theft of Social Security numbers result from what's called "spear-phishing."

These attacks start with a bogus email to a corporate executive that appears to be from a trusted employee asking to be sent all the W-2 records or some other confidential business files. If successful, the criminals will get highly sensitive data, typically information required for state and federal tax filings, as well as employee records.

"We were surprised by the scale of how successful these spear-phishing efforts were and how many of these types of breaches were reported last year," said Eva Velasquez, president and CEO of the Identity Theft Resource Center.

The Art of 'Spear Fishing'

Here's how it's done. Crooks learn the names and titles of corporate employees from online profiles. Then they create a spoofed email address that looks very similar to the real one — maybe add a letter or drop one from the company name.

Now they're ready to pose as an executive in the company — maybe John, the HR director — and send an email to the CEO requesting corporate records that John has the authority to see. The boss gets so much email from John that he doesn't catch the misspelling in the URL and sends the requested files.

"Spear-phishing is such an easy thing for companies to fix because all it requires is a process in place to handle these types of requests for sensitive data," Velasquez told NBC News. "Companies need to make sure they're not only protecting customer data, but also employee data. They need to have mechanisms in place to ensure that requests for sensitive employee information are legitimate."

Just last week, a hacker used a spear-phishing attack to impersonate the CEO of Sunrun, a solar company in San Francisco. The successful scam netted the crook W-2 forms for some company employees, according to a report in the San Francisco Chronicle.

Email Addresses and Passwords

Breach notifications often downplay the significance of the data stolen, noting that the hackers "only" gained access to email addresses and passwords.

But in many cases, that's all they need to steal personally identifiable information that enables them to commit other crimes. That's because so many people now keep financial and medical documents in their email accounts or store them via a cloud-based service.

"This is much more than a change-your-password problem," said Haywood Talcove, CEO of LexisNexis Special Services.

A survey of 1,000 adults done by LexisNexis Risk Solutions found that more than 35 percent store highly sensitive documents — from mortgage statements to student loan information — on their email services or with cloud-based document storage services. The survey showed that 42 percent of the respondents stored tax records, 40 percent stored bank records, and 35 percent stored health records this way. A sizable number (21 percent) even saved a list of PINS and passwords digitally — a very risky thing to do.

"It's frightening," Talcove told NBC News. "If the criminals have access to your user name and password, they have whatever is in there, not just the email between you and your spouse, not just the email between you and a work colleague, but important information that is absolutely critical to defrauding government and commercial entities."

What You Can Do

Most companies, organizations and government agencies collect personal information that is valuable to a hacker and that makes them a target. Security experts tell NBC News there must be a concerted effort to appreciate the growing threat and a commitment to fighting it.

"While there is no perfect security, there's really no excuse for not having a well-thought out plan to help protect that information and mitigate the impact of an incident if it happens," Craig Spiezle of the Online Trust Alliance told NBC News.

Spiezle believes business incentives are needed to accelerate "security by design" — a policy where security is built into systems from the ground up and not dealt with later. And he advises companies both large and small to adopt a corporate culture of security, where employees are made aware of the threats and trained on how to deal with them.

Inga Goddijn with Risk Based Solutions hopes corporate leaders will empower their IT teams to deal with the ever-changing threats and give them the financial support they need to be successful.

"We simply have to recognize that we're not going to solve this problem with one handy new tool or one shiny new appliance," Goddijn said. "I am a little bit pessimistic to be honest with you. I think we might see the situation get a little worse before we see it get better."

Herb Weisbaum is The ConsumerMan. Follow him on Facebook and Twitter or visit The ConsumerMan website. Snapchat’s become a fast favorite of fashion and all that advertising love showed up in its parent company’s IPO filing Thursday, which showed a dramatic boost in sales last year.

Snap Inc.’s revenues shot up to $404.5 million last year, up from $58.7 million in 2015. However, the company — which is investing heavily in its growth, for instance, introducing its camera-toting Spectacles last year — is still losing a massive amount of money: $514.6 million last year.

That’s not expected to temper investor enthusiasm too much, though, and the company’s offering is expected to raise as much as $25 billion.

The filing late Thursday also gave a peek at the secretive company’s internal workings.

Snap said: “Substantially all of our revenue comes from advertising, so our ability to generate revenue in a particular country depends on the size of its advertising market.”

It noted that global advertising spend — especially mobile advertising spend — is extremely concentrated, with more than 70 percent of overall advertising spend and nearly 85 percent of mobile advertising spend coming from the top 10 advertising markets, citing data from International Data Corp. The company also said that “on average, over 60 percent of its daily active users” are from countries on ICD’s top 10 advertising markets.

The company said its strategy is to invest in product innovation and “take risk to improve our camera platform,” noting that its focus is to drive user engagement because that can be monetized through advertising.

“We use the revenue we generate to fund future product innovation to grow our business,” the company said.

The company’s nonemployee directors include Joanna Coles, 54, chief content officer of Hearst Magazines, and A.G. Lafley, 69, former president and chief executive officer of the Procter & Gamble Co. Coles and Lafley are members of the firm’s nominating and corporate governance committee. Lafley is also on the firm’s compensation committee.

Coles received total compensation of $110,866 from Snap last year, which included stock awards valued at $75,866 and a cash retainer of $35,000. Lafley received compensation of $2.6 million, which included stock awards valued at $2.5 million and a $200,000 annual cash retainer to cover the costs of his travel to company meetings and events. Lafley’s retainer also is paid quarterly following the completion of each full quarter. A few chief executives joined protests against President Donald Trump's temporary ban on immigration from seven Muslim countries, but a larger group of CEOs remained publicly silent over fears of being targeted by the president, CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin said Monday.

The Financial Times' Gillian Tett said on CNBC's "Squawk Box" that she had spoken with CEOs who were privately upset by the executive order but worried about speaking out. "Squawk Box" co-host Sorkin said he had heard the same from his C-level sources.

"I had similar conversations with executives over the weekend, all of whom ... seemed to be upset about at least the implementation of this program," Sorkin said. "They are scared out of their minds about being attacked ... and what that's going to do for their business."

Tett said the CEOs she contacted were especially worried about the risk of speaking out in the context of Trump's potential backlash — and that of his supporters.

"The danger is twofold: Firstly, the fact that you've got a president who will tweet out statements that can be very damaging to the share price," Tett told "Squawk Box."

"But secondly, of course, you've got a lot of people who agree with what he's doing and who will take revenge against companies whether that's on social media or [via] boycott," she continued.

Tett said she hoped CEOs, especially those with seats on Trump's various advisory councils, would band together to push back on the president's controversial legislation.

"Maybe they should be trying to use some of their joint industry forums. Because people have come out and said, 'Yes, we love parts of [the] economic policies,' but it does not mean you have to endorse everything," Tett said.

"The really key question is, 'Will those CEOs who are now sitting on that advisory council actually use that power or are they just doing it for pure vanity play?" Tett asked. President Donald Trump issued an executive order Monday aimed at significantly reducing regulation for businesses. Surrounded by small business leaders in the Oval Office, Trump slashed the new regulations budget to $0 and told reporters, "There will be regulation, there will be control, but it will be a normalized control."

All businesses have to navigate around regulations, but for small businesses, where resources tend to be tight, the regulatory work can be particularly cumbersome — and costly.

The just-released 2017 Small Business Regulations Survey found that the average small business owner spends at least $12,000 a year dealing with regulations. In addition, 14 percent of small business owners spend more than 20 hours a month on federal regulations, and more than half of small business owners spend a staggering $83,019 average on regulatory costs in their first year of operation.

An Entrepreneurial Buzz Kill

Adam Robinson, founder of Hireology, says the company was formed and built "100 percent under the Obama administration," and that though it was able to grow over the course of just two years from 30 to 120 employees, navigating regulations has been a challenge. If he were starting his business last year, he doubts he'd have been able to flourish, due to certain regulations.

"I testified in front of the House Small Business Committee on the issue of Department of Labor changing the threshold at which non-exempt employees are eligible for overtime," said Robinson. "I told them that if this overtime regulation had been in place, I literally could not have hired my first employee."

Once a small business brings on a 50th employee, it faces another set of regulations, including the Affordable Care Act's employer mandate, which requires that all businesses with 50 or more full-time equivalent employees provide health insurance to at least 95 percent of their full-time employees and dependents up to age 26, or face a fee.

To avoid having to deal with that mandate, small businesses may be disinclined to expand.

"If I am a growing service business and I have 49 employees, there is an incentive to me to stop growing because as soon as I get to 50 I am mandated [under the Affordable Care Act] to provide healthcare to all my employees," said Robinson. "There's no incentive to grow if it places an administrative burden on my business."

What a Difference Trump Could Make

Trump's promises to repeal ACA, loosen regulations, and simplify the U.S tax code have many small businesses feeling optimistic.

"My team is very hopeful that Trump will make good on his promise of deregulation as well as on cutting corporate taxes," said Jake Tully, a spokesperson for TruckDrivingJobs.com. "One of our biggest roadblocks has been the trucking industry regulations that pertain to hours of service that drivers can operate within, as well as the mandatory reset rules that dictate an individual's ability to operate. These regulations are meant to benefit the well-being of drivers, but can hamper one's ability to succeed on the road and therefore hinders the industry as we know it."

Beth Zoller, legal editor at XpertHR, anticipates enhanced opportunity for small businesses under Trump.

"With his Republican pro-business leanings, President Trump will aim to reduce the regulatory burden on employers and smaller employers will see significant benefits to this as it will result in a savings of money, timem and resources," said Zoller, legal editor at XpertHR. "The economy could also grow as a result."

The Potential Downside of Deregulation and Revisions

The idea of spending less time and money on complying with regulations sounds pretty great, but some business owners are anxious about losing regulations that have a noble purpose.

"I am a small business owner myself and I think regulation is generally a good thing," said Steve Silberberg, owner of Fitpacking. "The [report] says that the average small business owner is spending at least $12,000 every year dealing with regulations, yet the report also shows that over one quarter (27 percent) of the respondents grossed between $1-5 million. So we're talking about less than 1 percent going to regulations."

A concern of Silberberg's, whose business is focused on backpacking adventures, is that Trump will deregulate National Parks, allowing anyone to go at any time with no permit.

"This would be pretty bad for my business," said Silberberg, adding, "For the moment, National Parks seem to be somewhat safe, but who's to say they won't open up the Grand Canyon to uranium mining?"

Rafael Romis, CEO of the small business Weberous, admits that he would love to pay fewer taxes and spend less time managing regulations, "but on the flip side, a lot of regulations exist for a good reason."

Romis also wonders how Trump will simplify the tax code and how changes there could impact small businesses.

"Redoing the tax code would affect the whole accounting industry and the small businesses that will have to learn it, said Romis. "That's a bit scary to me."

A Longing for Stability

Chris Eilers, president-elect of the Minnesota Chapter of Entrepreneurs' Organization and the CEO of Dunn Brothers Coffee, senses heightened anxiety in the small business community because of both the uncertainty around looming changes, and "the fact that there hasn't been a consistent approach to addressing regulations" in recent years.

"I think ultimately, small business owners are looking to see how a new administration will be able to effectively work with a Congress that hasn't shown its ability to really be bipartisan and pass meaningful regulation that would be good," said Eilers.

And there's another heart of the matter: What would be reasonable, but also good, and what does good mean in the land of regulations? It really depends on the business.

"If you rely on immigrant populations, from a staffing standpoint your concerns will be different than if you're a small business owner manufacturing products domestically," said Eilers.

"I think were all just waiting to see the details, and trust the administration understands that we're part of a world population and that we can't operate in a bubble." MONTESILVANO.

Publicidade

O governador do Rio, Luiz Fernando Pezão (PMDB), apresentou nesta quinta-feira (2) projeto de lei para venda da Cedae, a empresa de águas e esgoto do Estado.

Em mensagem enviada à Alerj (Assembleia Legislativa do Rio), o governo propõe a alienação da totalidade das ações da empresa em troca da autorização para a tomada de um empréstimo de R$ 3,5 bilhões.

O projeto significa na prática a venda da Cedae, mas é feito por meio de duas operações distintas.

Primeiro o governo coloca as ações da empresa como garantia para do empréstimo. Depois, se compromete a vender a empresa no prazo de um ano, pagar a dívida e obter um saldo.

A proposta não apresenta valores, diz apenas que "instituições financeiras federais" farão uma avaliação dos ativos da companhia para estruturar a venda.

O saldo será usado para pagar outras dívidas que o Estado tem com a União ou que tenha o governo como avalista.

Situação dos Estados

A venda é uma das exigências do governo federal no plano de recuperação fiscal do Estado do Rio, que exige também aumento de contribuição previdenciária dos servidores públicos.

A ideia é que o Rio tome uma série de medidas para ter direito a deixar de pagar pelos próximos três anos o serviço da dívida que tem com a União.

As medidas, contudo, precisam passar pela Assembleia e encontram forte resistência dos servidores públicos do Rio.

Os deputados prometem começar a analisar a proposta de venda da companhia no próximo dia 7. A votação está prevista para o dia 9. Servidores já convocaram protestos para as duas datas.

O procurador-geral da República Dominicana, Jean Rodríguez, revelou nesta quinta-feira detalhes do acordo assinado com a Odebrecht no último dia 20 de janeiro, pelo qual a construtora se comprometeu a abonar dita quantia, “o dobro da soma de US$ 92 milhões, que foi negociada tomando como referência a Lei 448-06 sobre Suborno no Comércio e no Investimento”.

Segundo o acordo, “dito montante será desembolsado paulatinamente em um prazo de oito anos, mediante pagamentos anuais parciais até janeiro do ano 2025, iniciando com um primeiro abono de US$ 30 milhões, desembolsado na assinatura do acordo na quarta-feira passada”.

“Em adição, a República Dominicana gozará de um direito de prelação ou privilégio na cobrança da indenização sobre os demais países afetados por subornos, com exceção de Estados Unidos, Brasil e Suíça”, afirmou o procurador.

Rodríguez destacou que, “além do Brasil, a República Dominicana se destaca como o único país latino-americano que, até a data, alcançou uma compensação que duplica o montante dos subornos reconhecidos, além de ser o único que receberá a totalidade da indenização pactuada em um prazo de oito anos, ao contrário dos prazos de mais de 20 anos negociados por Brasil, Colômbia, Panamá e Peru”.

Por outro lado, o procurador ressaltou que a assinatura do acordo econômico não paralisará as investigações.

“Seguiremos trabalhando sem descanso e até as últimas consequências para identificar os que aceitaram benefícios em prejuízo do Estado e toda a sociedade”, prometeu.

“Para esse fim, garantimos o fortalecimento da investigação local através de uma cláusula de cooperação no acordo, que obriga a Odebrecht a robustecer a potencial acusação do Ministério Público”, especificou Rodríguez.

O Ministério Público local exigiu que a Odebrecht aplique na filial dominicana da empresa as mesmas medidas de fortalecimento da ética, governança corporativa, integridade e transparência pactuadas com Brasil, Estados Unidos e Suíça, países onde também foi permitida a operar de maneira condicionada.

Estas ações deverão ser executadas em um prazo de 24 meses e os avanços na implementação deverão ser reportados ao Ministério Público mediante relatórios semestrais.

Como consequência deste compromisso, o Ministério Público solicitará a suspensão das medidas cautelares que tinha solicitado contra a empresa, incluindo a solicitação de inabilitação temporária perante a Direção Geral de Contratações Públicas.

Don’t miss: The two views of Snapchat—an app that has peaked or a platform ready to blossom

Snapchat, an app in which users send and view “snaps,” makes money from ads on the platform and content created by third-party channels such as news organizations. It also recently introduced a hardware product, Snapchat Specs, and has a payment feature called Snapcash.

Snap reported that its ephemeral messaging service had 158 million daily active users at the end of 2016, and an average of 2.5 billion “snaps” are created on Snapchat every day.

Before investing in Snapchat IPO, watch this (2:02) Snapchat's parent company Snap has filed to go public in what is expected to be the largest U.S.-listed tech IPO since 2014. But investors are concerned about its revenue model.

Here are six things to know about the company:

The financials

Snap reported growing revenues and increasing losses. Snap recorded $404.5 million in revenue in 2016, compared with $58.7 million in 2015. Net losses grew to $514.6 million in 2016, compared with a net loss of $372.9 million in 2015. Like many burgeoning tech startups, Snap warned that it “may never achieve or maintain profitability.”

Snap recorded a loss from operations of $520.4 million in 2016 and a loss of $381.7 million in 2015. Its global average revenue per user for the three months ended in December 2016 was $1.06, up from 31 cents in the year-earlier period.

The majority of Snap’s revenue in 2016, 98%, came from advertising.

A young, active user base

Snap had 158 million daily active users, which it says is a “critical measure” of user engagement, as of Dec. 31, 2016. Growth in daily active users has been pressured of late, though, growing by only 7% between the second and third quarters of 2016 and relatively flat growth in the final quarter. Snap mentioned competition in their prospectus, and that decline roughly coincides with Facebook Inc.’s FB, -0.20% early August launch of Instagram Stories, a product similar to one of SnapChat’s most popular features.

User growth is important for attracting advertisers and, consequently, the majority of Snap’s revenue. The majority of Snapchat users are 18-to-34 years old, a coveted advertising demographic that the company has reportedly been luring away from sites like Facebook. Users younger than 25 are among the most active on Snapchat, visiting the app more than 20 times a day and spending more than 30 minutes a day, as of the quarter ended December 2016, Snap said.

On average, daily active users visited Snapchat more than 18 times each day and spend 25 to 30 minutes there.

Still, Snap noted that the teen demographic is not “brand loyal” and could shift attention to another platform. Already the numbers show a seasonality, with engagement lower in summer months, according to the prospectus. Also, Snap may struggle to grow its user numbers in countries or areas without the high-bandwidth-capacity cellular networks the app requires, it said.

Retaining control

The company has three classes of common stock and plans to offer common A stock that will not give stockholders any voting power.

Owners of class B common stock will be entitled to one vote per share and holders of class C common stock, which include co-founders Evan Spiegel, 26, and Robert Murphy, 28, are entitled to 10 votes per share. With that ownership, both parties have “the ability to control the outcome of all matters” that are sent to the stockholders for approval. The filing does not yet disclose what percentage voting power they will have after the offering.

Spiegel, the company’s chief executive, had a salary of $503,205 in 2016, with a $1 million bonus and other compensation totaling $2.4 million. Under his offer letter, he will reduce his salary to $1 as of the effective date of the registration statement, with a cash bonus of $1 million. He will also receive restricted stock units, representing 3% of outstanding capital stock, in quarterly installments for three years, beginning in the third quarter after the offering.

If either are fired, they will still have “significant” voting power. If either die, shares will convert and the other co-founder will be able to exercise voting control over outstanding stock.

Don’t miss: Three reasons you should skip Snap IPO

Rivalries and a dependence on big companies

Snap uses Alphabet Inc’s GOOGL, +0.15% GOOG, +0.01% Google Cloud for much of its computing, storage, bandwidth and other needs. To that end, on Jan. 30, 2017, just three days before the filing, Snap committed to spend $2 billion with Google Cloud over the next five years. If that relationship were disrupted, Snap said its business would be “seriously harmed.” Snap sees its hosting costs with Google or others growing as its user base and engagement grows.

In terms of competition, Snap lists Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.15% Alphabet’s Google and Twitter Inc. TWTR, +0.72% Facebook may be a more direct threat, as Snap noted the new feature on Instagram that “largely mimics” its Snap Stories. These companies have greater resources and may have the ability to draw users away from Snap, the company admitted.

“We face significant competition in almost every aspect of our business both domestically and internationally,” the prospectus said.

Many buildings, but no headquarters

Snap has been known for keeping things under wraps, even within the company. To that end, the prospectus says the company has offices spread out across the U.S. and abroad, including several principal offices in Venice, Calif.

But those principal offices are still “dispersed throughout the city,” which Snap notes could hurt employee morale, retention and the company’s ability to oversee employees. The company had 1,859 employees at the end of 2016, up from 600 in 2015.

Still, the prospectus says the company has a tightknit and “kind” team.

“When we say ’kind,’ we mean the type of kindness that compels you to let someone know that they have something stuck in their teeth even though it’s a little awkward,” the prospectus says.

Moving past sexting

Snapchat launched in 2011 as platform to quickly send selfies. Its key advantage was that the “snaps” disappeared after they were sent, so users felt “comfortable sending photos of themselves even when they don’t look pretty or perfect.”

But the platform quickly developed a reputation for “sexting,” or sending racy selfies and videos.

“When we were just getting started, many people didn’t understand what Snapchat was and said it was just for sexting, even when we knew it was being used for so much more,” the prospectus says.

Moving on from selfies, Snap added videos and then the ability to send a photo or video to all of the user’s friends, thus launching “My Stories.” They added publisher stories in January 2015, opening up the feature to organizations with editorial teams.

Since those days, Snap has added more features, including lenses that superimpose over the user’s face and geofilters, allowing an overlay for the user’s location and for brand advertising. Synopsis

  Mettler-Toledo a accru ses résultats l'an dernier. Le fabricant américano-zurichois d'instruments de mesure, coté à la Bourse de New York, a enregistré un bénéfice net de 384,4 millions de dollars (381,6 millions de francs), soit une hausse de près de 9% par rapport à l'exercice 2015.

Le chiffre d'affaires a lui augmenté de 5% pour s'établir à 2,51 milliards de dollars ( 7% en monnaies locales), a indiqué jeudi soir l'entreprise dans un communiqué. La croissance a atteint 5% dans les régions Amériques et Europe et 10% en Asie et dans le reste du monde. Pour le seul 4e trimestre, le bénéfice net a progressé de près de 12% à 137,8 millions de dollars, tandis que les ventes ont augmenté de 5% à 709,7 millions de dollars ( 8% en monnaies locales).

Mettler-Toledo table sur une nouvelle amélioration de ses résultats pour 2017. (ats/nxp) Apart from the microfinance loans, Utkarsh has high priority on MSME and affordable housing lending. (PTI)

The focus on rural and semi-urban population is heartily welcomed in the Budget. This is the place where most of those at the ‘bottom of the pyramid’ and in the ‘missing middle’ segments of the society have their livelihood. Any boost for this segment is actually a boost to the economy.

Apart from the microfinance loans, Utkarsh has high priority on MSME and affordable housing lending. We are happy to see government’s impetus also on these two segments. The announcement on tax rates for companies with an annual turnover up to R50 crore to be reduced to 25% shall further strengthen the MSME sector. The Budget has also given affordable housing sector the status of infrastructure. The new measure will reduce costs for developers and attract investors. Our affordable housing segment lending is an effort to provide as well as renovate the dream house of financially excluded. We are happy to see allocation for Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana up from R15,000 crore to R23,000 crore.

The Budget also talks about specific priority to the tribal, dalit and women for setting up greenfield enterprises. The same priority at Utkarsh has helped us reach and serve over 12 lakh active client base today.

You may also like to watch:

The Budget has posed confidence that the surplus liquidity in banking system created by demonetisation will lower borrowing cost and increase access to credit. Post demonetisation, the Budget highlights the point that the government is now seen as a trusted custodian of public money, and we as a small finance bank (SFB) shall reaffirm the same in the Bharat version of our country. This shall further strengthen banks, especially the SFBs in serving their clients with more products and services.

Jaitley has also proposed to abolish FIPB— a long standing demand from foreign investors. This will improve flow of foreign investment. The minister also announced that further liberalisation of the FDI policy is under consideration.

Jaitley reduced the maximum donation that a political party can receive in cash to R2,000 from any one source. He added that no transaction of more than R3 lakh will be permitted in cash.

Further, initiatives to boost the digital face of banking like limiting the cash transactions upto R3 lakh value, announcement for Aadhaar-based payment system— Aadhaar Pay, more features on BHIM applications and likewise shall change the way India, especially the Rural India, banks.

As a boost to digitisation of the economy, the government has announced exemption from excise and customs duty on manufacturing or import of equipment used in such processes.

While the government’s commitment to introducing the Goods and Services Tax at the earliest has meant there have been no major changes to indirect tax, other tax proposals like the carry-forward of Minimum Alternate Tax credit for 15 years from 10 years is a welcome move.

The concessional withholding tax rate has been extended to June 30, 2020. It also includes the rupee denominated masala bond.

The FM has proposed to increase allowable provision for Non-Performing Asset of banks from 7.5% to 8.5%. However, we expected that the corporate tax would be lowered from the current 30%. We are a bit disappointed to see that the FM did not announce this in the Budget.

MD & CEO, Utkarsh Small Finance Bank Quem lê o Brasil navegando pelos sites de notícias, todos os dias, arrisca pensar que andamos no fim da linha. A Polícia Federal levando gente pra cadeia, os vazamentos seletivos, as “citações,” a raiva espalhada nas redes sociais. Vejo muita gente boa que entrou nessa onda. De minha parte, tento resistir. Há notícias boas escondidas por aí. Há 5.570 novos prefeitos, milhares de vereadores e gestores públicos assumindo seus postos e tentando fazer alguma coisa. Há muita gente pensando no futuro. Que bom. Não é só de futricas e relatos de propinas que é feito o Brasil. Gosto de pensar assim e desconfio que não estou sozinho.

A maioria dos gestores e parlamentares que assumiu dia primeiro de janeiro talvez não saiba, mas no mesmo dia entrou em vigor, para todos os municípios brasileiros, a Lei 13.019/14, que permite que a gestão dos serviços públicos municipais sejam executados por organizações privadas sem fins lucrativos.

Sendo mais claro: gestão de escolas, unidades de saúde, assistência social, cultura ou qualquer área que não cumpra funções “exclusivas” de estado podem ser contratadas pelos governos municipais junto a organizações da sociedade civil. As escolas municipais tem baixo desempenho? Ok, o prefeito pode desenhar um bom contrato de gestão e selecionar uma instituição educacional privada de alto padrão para gerenciar integralmente a escola; o hospital municipal ou os abrigos da prefeitura são ineficientes? Da mesma forma: o prefeito pode virar o jogo. Buscar as melhores instituições gestoras, junto ao setor privado, e repactuar toda a prestação do serviço.

O mesmo vale para museus, bibliotecas, centros de cultura e eventos, asilos, creches, parques ou áreas esportivas. Toda esta imensa malha de repartições públicas que consome quase todo o orçamento municipal e sobre a qual o prefeito praticamente não tem controle pode ser gerida com base em contratos com o setor privado. Com metas claras e avaliação de resultados. A instituição contratada não trabalhou direito? Foi alertada e não acertou o passo? Sem problemas: troca-se o fornecedor do serviço. O prefeito retoma o controle sobre a gestão de seu próprio governo. Volta a ter condições de responder à sociedade, que (com razão) exige cada vez mais. Além disso, deixa de onerar o sistema de previdência municipal e gerar mais e mais burocracia pública.

O modelo de gestão contratualizado ainda tem outra vantagem: estimula a busca de recursos para além do orçamento público. Um exemplo: em Nova Iorque, boa parte das bibliotecas públicas tem gestão privada (exatamente dentro deste modelo). Quando morei por lá, era um frequentador, e me impressionava o número de voluntários trabalhando nas mais diversas funções, de recepcionistas a professores de literatura e história americana. No curso que frequentei o professor era um executivo aposentado do mercado financeiro. Alguém dirá que isto só acontece em Nova Iorque. Errado. Acontece em qualquer lugar. Basta criar a oportunidade para que as pessoas participem. Indivíduos e empresas doarão seu tempo e recursos para organizações civis de qualidade. Mas não o farão para o “governo”.

A lei faz essencialmente três exigências: que as organizações contratadas tenham experiência e competência comprovada na área em que irão atuar, que não tenham fins lucrativos e que a sua escolha seja feita por um processo de seleção pública. Um concurso simples e efetivo. Conduzido com critério técnico e imparcialidade. E que o poder público elabore um bom “termo de colaboração”, isto é, um bom contrato, com objetivos bem definidos e critérios para cobrar resultados efetivos para os cidadãos.

Minha recomendação aos prefeitos: façam uma boa análise da Lei 13.019/14. Ela é um instrumento jurídico de inovação, que não gera obrigações, mas cria possibilidades. Se o prefeito quiser, pode continuar a tocar a máquina da prefeitura no modo tradicional, trocando lâmpadas nas escolas e comprando seringas nas unidades de saúde com a nossa velha lei das licitações; pode continuar abrindo concursos, aumentando a máquina pública e o poder das corporações. Mas agora ele tem uma alternativa: pode gerenciar de um jeito novo, leve, exigindo a responsabilização de quem executa os serviços.

Haverá, por óbvio, quem diga que não é bem assim. Haverá quem não entenda exatamente o que são “atividades exclusivas de estado”. Haverá quem diga que tudo não passa de mais uma tentativa de “privatização” dos serviços públicos. Isto mesmo que a Lei tenha sido formulada, votada e sancionada pela ex-Presidente Dilma. Minha sugestão: que os gestores saibam separar o joio do trigo. Identificar o que é interesse público e o que não passa de simples jogo corporativo. Ao final do dia, são eles, os prefeitos, que serão cobrados pela qualidade dos serviços prestados à sociedade.

Fernando L. Schüler é cientista político e professor do Insper. President Donald Trump continued to court his pro-manufacturing base with yet another summit involving a chief executive officer, greeting Harley-Davidson Inc. executives and union officials at the White House on Thursday.

The event was a meeting and listening session, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said in a press briefing, calling the motorcycle maker an “American success story since 1901.”

“We want to make it easier for business to create more jobs and more factories to be made in the U.S. and you’re a great example of that,” Trump told the executives.

Trump is seeking to uphold campaign promises to return lost manufacturing jobs to the U.S. The president has met with the CEOs of the traditional domestic automakers as well as the heads of Dow Chemical Co., Whirlpool Corp., Lockheed Martin Corp. and U.S. Steel Corp. all in his first two weeks in office, indicating he’ll take a hands-on role in U.S. corporate decision-making, especially if it’ll lead to job creation for middle-class Americans. Mary Barra, General Motors Co.’s CEO, will return to the White House on Friday for her second meeting in as many weeks.

Joining Trump for the Harley meeting were executives including CEO Matthew Levatich and union officials representing workers at the Milwaukee-based company. Harley’s home state of Wisconsin, which surprised some pollsters when it awarded its 10 electoral votes to Trump, has traditionally supported Democratic candidates with pro-union policies.

Wisconsin Base

Trump canceled a scheduled visit to Wisconsin on Thursday to deliver a speech on the economy and manufacturing out of concern that the event would attract protesters, CNN reported Tuesday. The company’s powertrain facility in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, was being considered for a presidential visit but nothing had officially been scheduled, Maripat Blankenheim, a Harley-Davidson spokeswoman, said Thursday.

Harley-Davidson said in October it planned to temporarily lay off about 225 salaries employees to cut costs amid weak motorcycle sales, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported at the time.

Trump isn’t the first politician to try to wrap himself in the motorcycle brand. Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, during his failed presidential bid in 2015, used his own Harley-Davidson motorcycle and connections to the company as a symbol of American freedom, independence and to sell a regular guy image.

Like Walker, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus is from Wisconsin and familiar with the company and its record of working with unions to gain efficiency.

Helping Harley

Harley’s success has been helped by government assistance, something often labeled “corporate welfare” by members of the Republican Party.

Since 2000, the motorcycle manufacturer has benefited from $54.5 million in local and state subsidies and more than $2 billion in federal liquidity support, according to Good Jobs First, a group in Washington that monitors business incentives.

The vast majority of the subsidies have come from Missouri, where in 1998 the company opened a factory after asking several states for economic development incentives offers. Missouri awarded Harley roughly $44 million, the Good Jobs First data show. Much of it came in the form of a reduction in Harley’s state income tax liability, in exchange for meeting hiring and other goals. The data show $2.3 million in assistance from Wisconsin, all before Walker took office.

At the peak of the financial crisis in late 2008 and early 2009, the Federal Reserve also helped Harley at least indirectly by backstopping the commercial paper market. Former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, in a 2011 letter to members of Congress, highlighted the manufacturer as a success story, saying that one of the Fed’s programs to fight the financial crisis“provided support to businesses as diverse as Harley-Davidson and National Rural Utilities, when the usual market mechanism for their day-to-day funding completely dried up.”

In the past, company officials have stressed that federal assistance didn’t involve a direct loan and that Harley-Davidson’s involvement in the program was for less than four months.    REUTERS: Cybersecurity firm FireEye Inc reported its first drop in quarterly revenue and forecast current-quarter billings well below analysts' estimates, sending its shares down as much as 20 percent.

FireEye, which provides web, email and malware security to businesses and governments, also said both its chairman and chief financial officer would leave, a setback for the company as it shifts its business to a cloud-based model.

Chairman David DeWalt, who stepped down as chief executive last year, led the company as it handled a string of high-profile data breaches over the last few years.

Chief Financial Officer Mike Berry is leaving the company to take up a similar role at another company. Frank Verdecanna, FireEye's chief accounting officer, will replace Berry.

The company forecast revenue of US$160 million-US$166 million for the current quarter, missing the average analyst estimate of US$176.6 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

FireEye said it expects first-quarter billings - a closely watched indicator of future business - in the range of US$130 million to US$150 million, well below the average estimate of US$186.3 million, according to research firm FactSet StreetAccount.

Vacancies in the company's sales teams affected revenue in the fourth quarter, Chief Executive Officer Kevin Mandia said on a conference call.

Key positions, including heads of the worldwide and Europe sales teams, were vacant during the second half of last year, Mandia said. The positions have since been filled.

Billings fell 14 percent in the fourth quarter to US$221.8 million, hurt by lower-than-expected product sales.

Analysts on average had estimated billings of US$240.3 million, according to FactSet.

The company's revenue fell for the first time since its market debut in 2013 to US$184.7 million, missing the average estimate of US$191 million.

Excluding items, FireEye reported a loss of 3 cents per share, beating the average estimate of a loss of 16 cents, helped by lower expenses.

Net loss attributable to shareholders more than halved to US$61.5 million, or 37 cents per share, from US$136.1 million, or 87 cents per share.

(Reporting by Narottam Medhora in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta and Saumyadeb Chakrabarty) A buyer can still benefit from a home inspection on a new or newer home. (Photo: Getty Images/iStockphoto)

Reader Question: I am a home inspector. I work with an agent who is always pressuring me to “take it easy.” I refuse to lower my standards, but I’m concerned about him finding a replacement. How would you suggest I approach this?

Monty's Answer: The situation you describe might be a very delicate matter, and no matter what you decide, it might not be the right solution. In many respects, this is a primary challenge of being in business. No one likes to lose a good customer, but sometimes, we lose customers for reasons beyond our control.

RELATED: 10 questions to ask when hiring a home inspector

RELATED: When a home inspection is not enough

When I was a rookie real estate agent, a local lender used a lawyer that nit-picked every title and found tiny flaws that sometimes jeopardized a sale and created extra work. The experienced agents in town steered their business to other lenders. I learned to do the same.

Then, I bought my first house. Suddenly, I wanted to ensure there were no flaws in the title. I took my mortgage to that lender because I knew the lawyer would not miss anything. From that day forward, I added that bank to my provider list.

This story bears similarities to your situation. I was worried about my income because of a good lawyer; your inspector is concerned about his income because of a good inspector.

Here are some options

1. Ignore him. 95 percent of the things we worry about never happen, and he might just be worrying out loud when inspection time rolls around.

2. Ask him to have a conversation with you over a cup of coffee. Tell him you want to discuss his concern about your thoroughness when conducting an inspection. Tell him you value the professional relationship the two of you share. The goal of the meeting is for you to seek to understand his thinking. Only when you more closely examine the "take it easy" suggestion can you get a better sense of an approach to take with him. The principle here is: Seek first to understand — then be understood.

One question you might want to ask him is if he were to buy another home, would he want you to inspect it? You could also share why a proper inspection makes him look good, and a not-so-good inspection makes him look bad.

3. Reciprocate. Assuming you believe the agent is an efficient agent (because you witness him working with his clients when they attend the inspection), put him on the top of your recommended real estate agent list.

4. Ask yourself; Are you too picky? Is the agent trying to tell you in a nice way that some of your observations are above and beyond what is required by law? Every state laws and inspection regulations are different. What does the law or administrative rule say that sets consumer expectations? In most states, the inspection clause in the purchase contracts refers to material defects. For example, in Wisconsin, the word "defect" is defined in the purchase agreement. It states:

DEFECT: "Defect" means a condition that would have a significant adverse effect on the value of the property; that would significantly impair the health or safety of future occupants of the property; or that if not repaired, removed or replaced would significantly shorten or adversely affect the expected normal life of the premises.

Have you seen his contract? In many states, the seller has the " right to cure." In others the “ right to cure ” is negotiated; and in others, no mention of it. If there is no seller’s "right to cure," a defect might give the buyer an escape route. This information might be helpful in understanding why the agent is saying "take it easy."

Has the agent ever seen your contract? What does it say you will do for your customer? My experience is most inspectors have differences in their contract offerings, which is one reason why a consumer should compare inspectors. Does he understand your unique selling proposition? It could be that once the agent knows your side of the equation, he might come to appreciate it.

Customers might want more than what the state expects in the definition of defects. They will sometimes use the inspection as a bargaining chip. You can be "damned if you do and damned if you don't" in the inspection business.

Every state is different, so a bit of reading and conversation on your part might lead to reaching a satisfactory arrangement between the two of you.

But wait, this may not be as nefarious as it seems. An expert on international trade law tells the Fiscal Times that Thursday's exemption is simply fixing an accidental consequence of a sanction enacted on FSB by then-President Obama in December. The exemption will allow US companies to buy a needed license from FSB in order to sell products containing encryption capabilities, such as Microsoft Word or "really any Microsoft product," in Russia. Meanwhile, Nikki Haley told the UN that Russian sanctions would remain in place until Russia pulls out of Crimea, CNN reports. The new US ambassador to the UN asked Russia to stop violence in the Ukraine during an emergency UN meeting on Thursday.

The latest New Zealand Manufacturers and Exporters Association (NZMEA) Survey of Business Conditions completed during January 2017, shows total sales in December 2016 increased 7.23% (year on year export sales increased by 10.01% with domestic sales increasing by 3.30%) on December 2015.

In the 3 months to December, export sales decreased an average of 1.4%, and domestic sales increased 11.7% on average.

The NZMEA survey sample this month covered NZ$275m in annualised sales, with an export content of 60%.

Net confidence rose to 10, up from 8 in November.

The current performance index (a combination of profitability and cash flow) is at 99.3, up from 98.3 last month, the change index (capacity utilisation, staff levels, orders and inventories) was at 101, with no change from the last survey, and the forecast index (investment, sales, profitability and staff) is at 104.5, up on the last result of 103.2. Anything over 100 indicates expansion.

Constraints reported were 78% markets and 22% skilled staff.

A net 45% of respondents reported a productivity increase in December.

Staff numbers decreased 7.9% year on year in December.

Supervisors, tradespersons, managers, professional/scientists and operators/labourers reported a moderate shortage.

"December’s manufacturing sales results showed a good bounce back from the results seen in October, September and July, particularly in export sales - manufacturers ended the year on a high note." Said Dieter Adam.

"Export sales in December improved 10.01% on the same month in 2015, which was higher than the increase of 6.44% reported in November. These results translated into an average month decrease of -1.4% in the 3 months to December, which was still held down in the negative due to a poor month for exports in October.

"Domestic sales in December stayed positive with a 3.3% increase on December 2015. This was, however, a moderation on the exceptional growth felt in the previous three months. The average monthly growth of domestic sales in the 3 months to December remained high at 11.7%.

"We can now get a good picture on how the manufacturing sector fared in 2016. Domestic sales experienced an average monthly growth of 5.8% on the previous year’s months over the last 12 months, representing a positive trend of domestic sales. Export sales saw an average monthly growth of 2.1% in the same period. 2016 most definitely had its ups and downs for manufacturing sales, but overall, the trend showed solid growth for the year overall.

"The downward trend in export sales towards the end of the year was concerning - though the last two months of the year did turn this around somewhat. Weak export numbers have been reflected in the Statistics New Zealand numbers - in December, mechanical machinery and equipment exports fell 8.83% on December 2015, while electrical machinery and equipment fell 13.5%. This is a reminder that we need to renew focus on building high-value exports and push for growth in these areas. " Said Dieter. Snap, la maison-mère de la populaire messagerie mobile Snapchat, a officialisé jeudi son très attendu projet d'entrée en Bourse, qui pourrait être l'un des plus gros lancements à Wall Street depuis celui du chinois Alibaba en septembre 2014.

Dans le document publié jeudi sur le site internet du gendarme boursier américain (SEC), Snap se fixe l'objectif provisoire de lever jusqu'à 3 milliards de dollars.

Ce montant est uniquement utilisé pour l'instant afin de calculer les frais d'enregistrement et il évoluera quand le nombre exact de titres et leur prix d'introduction sera fixé, mais il donne déjà une idée de l'importance de l'opération.

Snap mise sur une introduction en Bourse dès le mois de mars et pourrait alors être valorisé entre 20 et 25 milliards de dollars, selon des sources. Cela représenterait la valorisation la plus élevée pour une IPO dans le secteur des hautes technologies aux Etats-Unis depuis celle de Facebook, dont le service concurrent Instagram compte 600 millions d'utilisateurs actifs.

Ses premiers pas sur le marché seront d'autant plus suivis qu'ils pourraient servir à prendre la température et peut-être convaincre d'autres candidats potentiels pour Wall Street, comme Airbnb, Spotify ou Uber par exemple. Ces startups très en vue partagent en effet avec Snap des valorisations très élevées, dans lesquelles certains observateurs dénoncent une nouvelle «bulle» du secteur technologique.

Trip Chowdhry, analyste chez Global Equities Research, conseillait ainsi encore récemment de rester à l'écart de l'entrée en Bourse de Snapchat, à la valeur selon lui «hyper gonflée» comme avant lui Zynga, Groupon, FitBit ou GoPro, dont les performances boursières se sont avérées décevantes, ou pour les investisseurs spéculatifs de revendre les titres à la première occasion.

Nasdaq boudé

Vu le délai que l'entreprise doit désormais respecter avant d'entamer son «roadshow», la tournée officielle de présentation aux investisseurs qui précède l'entrée en Bourse, Snap est désormais en position pour faire ses premiers pas sur le marché en mars.

Comme Twitter ou Alibaba avant lui, Snap a préféré se lancer sur le New York Stock Exchange plutôt que sur la plateforme électronique Nasdaq. Celle-ci a longtemps été considérée comme une destination évidente pour les entreprises du secteur technologique, mais sa réputation a été écornée ces dernières années par une série de problèmes techniques.

Une autre décision surprenante de l'entreprise est son choix de mettre sur le marché des actions qui ne seront assorties d'aucun droit de vote. Cela permettra de maintenir le contrôle effectif de Snap aux mains de ses co-fondateurs Evan Spiegel (directeur général) et Bobby Murphy (directeur technique), qui se partagent aujourd'hui 88,6% des droits de vote. Toutefois ce qui ne s'était encore jamais vu pour une introduction en Bourse à Wall Street pourrait susciter la défiance de certains investisseurs.

Hausse des utilisateurs

Le groupe basé à Los Angeles a annoncé avoir réalisé un chiffre d'affaires 2016 de 404,5 millions de dollars, contre 58,7 millions en 2015, avec une augmentation de 48% de son nombre d'utilisateurs actifs à 158 millions. Malgré cette forte croissance, l'exercice s'est soldé par une perte de 514,6 millions de dollars à comparer à un résultat négatif de 372,9 millions en 2015.

Snapchat a acquis une grande popularité auprès des adolescents et des jeunes adultes grâce à ses messages qui disparaissent peu après avoir été vus par leurs destinataires, et revendique 168 millions d'utilisateurs quotidiens. Il est considéré par beaucoup d'analystes comme l'ennemi numéro un pour Facebook, justement en raison de sa capacité à lui «voler» ce jeune public très recherché.

L'entreprise d'Evan Spiegel avait aussi lancé l'an dernier des lunettes connectées et équipées d'une caméra miniature («Spectacles»). La société qui a triplé ses effectifs l'an dernier à 1859 salariés avait décidé à cette occasion de se rebaptiser Snap afin de montrer qu'elle ne se limitait plus à un seul produit. (AFP/nxp) Mettler-Toledo a accru ses résultats l'an dernier. Le fabricant américano-zurichois d'instruments de mesure, coté à la Bourse de New York, a enregistré un bénéfice net de 384,4 millions de dollars (381,6 millions de francs), soit une hausse de près de 9% par rapport à l'exercice 2015.

Le chiffre d'affaires a lui augmenté de 5% pour s'établir à 2,51 milliards de dollars ( 7% en monnaies locales), a indiqué jeudi soir l'entreprise dans un communiqué. La croissance a atteint 5% dans les régions Amériques et Europe et 10% en Asie et dans le reste du monde. Pour le seul 4e trimestre, le bénéfice net a progressé de près de 12% à 137,8 millions de dollars, tandis que les ventes ont augmenté de 5% à 709,7 millions de dollars ( 8% en monnaies locales).

Mettler-Toledo table sur une nouvelle amélioration de ses résultats pour 2017. (ats/nxp) Casino revenue growth in Macau slowed down during January, falling short of analysts’ estimates, as the world’s largest gaming hub prepares for what may be another bumpy ride in its recovery from a two-year slump.

Every year during the Chinese New Year Festival, Macau welcomes crowds mainly from the tourism market of Mainland China. The road that leads to the Ruins of St. Paul was packed with visitors, as well as the shops alongside the slope up to one of the iconic tourism spots in Macau.

The Times interviewed a few shop owners who have their businesses in the vicinity of the Senado Square and the Ruins of St. Paul, and received a great variety of reactions regarding sales during the Chinese holiday.

Veng Io K, a book vendor in her 60s with a business located right next to the Igreja de São Domingos, spoke happily of her sales during the holidays. “The business was really good,” she said, adding that “it was a lot better than in previous years.”

Veng said that there were more people visiting her shop, as well passing by her premises. “In the previous years, there were not this many people,” she recalled. Her shop sells children toys and Chinese books, including Fengshui books and books about China’s politics. Some of these cannot be found in Mainland China. “All products were being sold, whether it was the Fengshui books, political books, or toys,” said Veng, adding that “business went up 30 percent.”

The owner of another shop, which sells food including dried seafood and is also situated at the center of the aforementioned tourism area, said that business yesterday was similar to that of the previous Chinese New Year because, for the first time, it opened during the holiday.

A traditional shop nearby, which sells simple clothing items, saw a decrease in sales. The owner Lok Win Ma, who is about 50 years old, had his shop open during the whole holiday period, but his business decreased 10 percent year-on-year. However, Li explained that the reasons for the drop are not directly associated with the holiday itself but with other factors. “Nowadays, people like to do shopping online,” he said, further indicating that even when compared to non-holiday periods throughout the year, business during the Chinese New Year was still slower.

The restaurant Curry Veng, 咖喱荣, where people can only buy take-away food, recorded a 30 percent growth in its revenue. Four restaurants owned by the same person, under the same brand name, can be found in the vicinity of Senado Square. The travel agency Chinoy Express Travel and Tours, which does business mainly with Filipinos, told the Times that, compared to regular days, there were more Filipinos applying for a Chinese visa during the Chinese New Year.

Owners at the Filipino eatery Sarimanok, located at Rua da Alfândega, said that their business during the holiday this year was “extremely low” when compared to last year’s, adding that the restaurant depends primarily on its Filipino market in town.

Vendor Chao Chi Veng, who sells chestnuts right next to Senado Square, said that his business was also worse compared to last year because it rained during the first three days of the Chinese New Year.

Chan Wai Chong, salesman at Loja Das Conservas, said that some customers visited the shops looking for specific products, which unfortunately were already sold out. Chan noted that the shop only opened yesterday, and that Chinese New Year business was similar to that of non-holiday days. JZ/LV

Fireworks vendors say business cooled down

Several fireworks sellers at the two legal fireworks trade spots in the city have reported a decrease in business revenues during the Chinese New Year, as assessed from the beginning of the Chinese New Year until midnight yesterday. The vendors have complained that few visitors have shown up. The weak sales might have possibly be due to rainy weather during the first days of the Chinese New Year. Several vendors reported that business this year did not meet their expectations, with the number of visitors being significantly less than the previous year. However, the vendors claim to be willing to continue operating in the fireworks market next year, even if this year was a disappointment. The Affordable Care Act's insurance exchanges have become too risky for major health insurers, and that's creating further doubt about coverage options consumers might have next year.

Anthem CEO Joseph Swedish said Wednesday his company is waiting to see whether the government makes some short-term fixes to the shaky exchanges before it decides how much it will participate next year. The Blue Cross-Blue Shield carrier is the nation's second largest insurer and sells coverage on exchanges in 14 states.

This is a separate and more immediate concern for consumers beyond whether the ACA will continue to exist. Congressional Republicans and President Donald Trump have vowed to repeal and replace the law. Republicans have promised they won't strand those now covered under the program, but they also haven't detailed their replacement plan.

Even if parts of the law continue to exist in some form, as many expect, the insurance exchanges through which millions have bought coverage are in peril. Swedish told Wall Street analysts during a conference call that if Anthem doesn't see stability in the exchanges heading into next year, "then we will begin making some very conscious decisions with respect to extracting ourselves."

The enrollment window for 2018 coverage is still several months away, but insurers have to decide by this spring whether they will participate.

Aetna, the nation's third largest insurer, said Tuesday that it will announce by April 1 whether it will stay in any of the four states where it currently sells coverage. Aetna said it lost $450 million last year on its ACA-compliant coverage - a big hit from a small slice of its overall business.

“ We still need certainty about short-term fixes in order to determine the extent of our participation in the individual market in 2018.”

The losses that insurers have taken from coverage sold on these state-based exchanges in recent years have already prompted some to scale back their participation or raise rates, often dramatically. The higher prices and dwindling choices have made the markets unappealing for many consumers.

Insurers say they've struggled to attract young, healthy customers to their risk pools to help keep coverage costs in check. They also say they've been hurt by expensive customers who use special enrollment periods to sign up for coverage only when they need help paying big medical bills.

Swedish, the Anthem CEO, said Wednesday that his company has had extensive talks with Congressional leaders. Anthem would like to see fewer special enrollment periods and better verification of patients who are eligible, as well as the repeal of a health insurance tax and other fixes.

“ Insurers really have to believe they see a future for a little while longer to continue to invest.”

"While the direction in Washington has been positive, we still need certainty about short-term fixes in order to determine the extent of our participation in the individual market in 2018," he said.

Separately, Tennessee insurance commissioner Julie McPeak told a US Senate panel Wednesday that Congress needs to send the industry a clear signal by March to avoid disrupting the individual health insurance market for 2018.

"You need to provide some indication to plans as a quickly as possible," she told the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions committee.

Representatives of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services did not respond Wednesday to requests for comment on the exchanges.

Congress may wind up addressing several insurer concerns, but short-term fixes may not be enough to guarantee 2018 exchange participation, according to Gary Claxton, an insurance expert at the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation.

Claxton thinks insurers also will watch closely the debate over the fate of the ACA and, with it, the long-term prospects of the individual insurance market.

"Insurers really have to believe they see a future for a little while longer to continue to invest," he said. Spices are common ingredients in many dishes across Nigeria and beyond. We love them for the rich flavor, colour and taste they give our food. They play such an important role in our daily lives that it’s difficult to imagine our world without spices. Spices are consumed daily by almost the whole Nigerian population. This means it is a good business to venture int. With good spice branding and packagin, you will add values to the society, which will in turn take you to the millionaire status.

Spices include but are not limited to curry, thyme, crayfish, pepper and so on. The production of spices is one simple task that any ambitious aspiring Agribusiness entrepreneur can start and grow up. This means you do not need any technicalities to start the production and marketing of spices.

What exactly are spices?

Spices are dried parts of plants that usually have strong and special smells/flavours. They can come from different parts of a plant including: the seeds, fruit, roots, bark, stems, rhizomes or flowers (like saffron). such as pepper,ginger,uda,dawada,ose Nsukka,garlic,uziza(leave or seed), Shallot, Ogiri,okpeye,iru,dry or powdered onions.

Opportunities Spice business

There are different opportunities in spice business in Nigeria. Let’s look at the broad areas through which entrepreneurs can enter the spice business.

Cultivation: Most of the world’s spices are grown in tropical regions of the world where sunlight and rainfall are abundant all year round. Countries like Ethiopia, Madagascar and Tanzania earn significant foreign exchange earnings by exporting spices and herbs to Europe and the United States.

Most spices are easy to cultivate and usually don’t require a lot of land, advanced technology or machines. However, to enjoy commercial success, you may need to acquire a sizeable piece of land for cultivation. Depending on the type of spice, the farming techniques and requirements may differ. Whether you plan to focus on cultivating foreign or local spices, the demand for these commodities will make such a venture worthwhile.

Trading & Processing: If you don’t have the land, skill or time to cultivate spices, you could buy the fresh and half-processed spices from farmers and sell them to processing facilities or process them yourself for export and for local market. When spices are processed (usually dried), they last longer and retain their value. As a result, most spices can be stored for longer periods without any need for advanced or expensive storage facilities. Blending/Branding: If you’re creative, you could blend (put together) a number of spices that could become your own branded recipe. Look in your kitchen and you’ll likely find some of these ‘ordinary’ spices that have been branded in attractive packaging and sold under popular brand names.

The beautiful thing about brand names is that you earn the right to charge customers more for the same product. Are there local spices in your area that are sold ‘naked’ in the open market? This is opportunity to make money and add value to our economy. Package the spices in an attractive bottle, sachet or anything that works for you. Give your product a name to set it apart from the ‘ordinary’ and ‘naked’ spices in the open market. The best part is, you will be creating a recognizable product locally and internationally (that’s if you plan to export) and of course, you can sell at a higher price.

How To Go About The Production Of Spices.

Here you will be dealing directly with farmers or local dealers, you get these spices in raw form from them like curry leafs, ginger, thyme leafs, dried pepper, uda,dawada,ose Nsukka,garlic,uziza(leave or seed), Shallot, Ogiri,okpeye,iru,dry or powdered Onions e.t.c. Mill them into powder either differently or in mixed blend. The milling of these spices does not need any big machines either as you can outsource that of those local dealers if you don’t have them or cannot purchase them.

Another important fact you should take note of is quality control, here you will have to make sure your product is free from any form of dirt particles and edible for use. As time goes on, you will apply for the compulsory NAFDAC and SON number. However, this should not deter you from starting as you can start now for your product and brand to gain acceptance from the public.

Finally the machinery you need which can be outsourced are Jan. 27, the Connecticut legislature’s Auditors of Public Accounts released a concerning report. It noted that in 2016, “large payments (were) made by state agencies to departing state employees.” These payments apparently “were made for the purpose of avoiding costs associated with litigation or as part of non-disparagement agreements.” Some were not authorized by state Attorney General George C. Jepsen or Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, the officials allowed by state law to approve such payments.

The report also pointed out settlement and non-disparagement agreements do not explicitly protect former employees’ right to serve as whistle-blowers.

Connecticut’s fiscal woes speak for themselves. They present a formidable threat to the state’s future. Accordingly, care must be taken to safeguard every dollar. Obviously, that wasn’t done in the cases of the unauthorized payments.

As the conservative, East Hartford-based Yankee Institute for Public Policy asked in a news release, “What is going on in our state agencies?” Such carelessness is unlikely to help improve the financial picture. It is even more jaw-dropping in light of the report’s conclusion that “many” of the payments exceeded $100,000.

The episode may continue Connecticut’s generally poor showings on the 24/7 Wall Street website’s “The Best and Worst Run States in America” survey.

In addition to troubled finances, Connecticut has a well-known reputation for political corruption. It is embarrassing, and blocks economic progress. Honest, thorough attempts to root out further malfeasance are necessary if the state is to shed the “Corrupticut” moniker. Non-disparagement and settlement agreements that do not explicitly protect whistle-blower status are detrimental.

The auditors’ report outlined significant issues Connecticut residents and business people must be apprised of. To date, it has received little – if any – attention aside from Yankee’s story and news release. State media outlets would be wise to spotlight it. That may prompt the people to demand changes to the unacceptable status quo.

 L’AQUILA. È ufficiale. Il ministero per lo Sviluppo economico (Mise) ha emanato il decreto che sancisce la nascita della Camera di commercio del Gran Sasso d’Italia, frutto della fusione tra L’Aquila e Teramo. Il provvedimento porta la data del 27 gennaio scorso. Nominato commissario ad acta Giampiero Sardi, attuale segretario generale della Camera teramana, che avrà il compito di avviare le procedure per la costituzione del consiglio. E di traghettare, verso la formazione del nuovo ente, le Camere di commercio dell’Aquila, guidata da Lorenzo Santilli, e di Teramo, con il presidente Gloriano Lanciotti. Quest’ultimo super-favorito nella corsa alla candidatura per la gestione della Camera interprovinciale. Il percorso si chiuderà nel giro di qualche mese.

NUOVA ERA. Il Mise ha posto un punto fermo nel lungo iter di fusione, avviato con mesi di ritardo rispetto alle Camere di Chieti e Pescara. «La Camera di commercio del Gran Sasso d’Italia», si legge nel decreto, «è operativa dalla data di insediamento del nuovo consiglio. Gli organi delle Camere di commercio dell’Aquila e Teramo decadono, mentre i beni patrimoniali dei due enti confluiranno nella nuova struttura». Per le zone interne abruzzesi si apre una nuova fase gestionale, che vedrà uniti due territori simili per peculiarità e connotazioni del tessuto imprenditoriale.

COMMISSARIO AD ACTA. È Giampiero Sardi, segretario generale della Camera di commercio di Teramo, il commissario ad acta designato dal Governo per costituire il nuovo consiglio camerale, che eleggerà il presidente. «La Camera di commercio del Gran Sasso d’Italia è nata formalmente a novembre scorso», afferma Sardi, «la mia funzione, in qualità di commissario, sarà quella di adottare una serie di adempimenti quali la verifica dei dati delle singole associazioni di categoria, che andranno a formare il nuovo consiglio camerale. La volontà è concludere il percorso nel più breve tempo possibile».

SANTILLI SFAVORITO. Nessuna conferma diretta, ma l’accordo politico, su base territoriale, prevede che la sede legale della Camera di commercio del Gran Sasso d’Italia venga istituita all’Aquila, come indicato anche nel testo del decreto. A fronte di ciò, la presidenza dovrebbe andare a Teramo tagliando fuori dai giochi Lorenzo Santilli, 60 anni, eletto a febbraio 2011 e attuale presidente dell’Ente aquilano. Diversa la posizione di Gloriano Lanciotti, dato per favorito nel toto-nomi per la guida della nuova struttura camerale.

GRANDI NUMERI. Sulla base dei dati di bilancio, il patrimonio totale ammonterà ad oltre 17 milioni di euro. La dotazione organica sarà di 80 dipendenti considerando che, nel 2016, il percorso di razionalizzazione del personale ha portato alla riduzione di 10 lavoratori, con un risparmio di 468mila euro.

CAMERA VERDE. Un territorio vasto, il più “verde” e protetto d’Europa. La Camera del Gran Sasso d’Italia, con 79.474 imprese iscritte che producono circa 9 miliardi di

valore aggiunto, gestirà un’area che comprende tre parchi nazionali, un parco regionale e una zona marina protetta. Uno dei primi impegni del nuovo organismo sarà quello di offrire una risposta concreta al mondo imprenditoriale, dopo le recenti calamità naturali.

Copyright Business Wire 2017 WASHINGTON (AP) — Declaring that religious freedom is “under threat,” President Donald Trump vowed Thursday to repeal a rarely enforced IRS rule that says pastors who endorse candidates from the pulpit risk losing their tax-exempt status.

“I will get rid of and totally destroy the Johnson Amendment and allow our representatives of faith to speak freely and without fear of retribution,” Trump said at the National Prayer Breakfast, a high-profile event bringing together faith leaders, politicians and dignitaries.

Trump’s pledge was a nod to his evangelical Christian supporters, who helped power his White House win. So far he has not detailed his plans for doing away with the rule, which he has previously promised to rescind. Named after then-Sen. Lyndon Johnson, the regulation has been in place since 1954 for tax-exempt charities, including churches, though it is very rare for a church to actually be penalized.

Abolishing the amendment would require action by Congress, though Trump could direct the IRS to disregard the rule. The tax code does allow a wide range of political activity by houses of worship, including speaking out on social issues and organizing congregants to vote. But churches cannot endorse a candidate or engage in partisan advocacy.

Lloyd Mayer, a law professor at the University of Notre Dame, said an IRS move could prompt lawsuits, if the rule was repealed for churches but not other charities.

Mayer also noted that a full repeal of the rule could open up churches to the possibility of spending their resources to openly try to influence elections — and for donors to get tax breaks for political contributions.

While some conservative Christians would like to see the rule abolished, others, especially the younger generation, support a clear separation of church and political endorsements. Many liberal churches are also active on policy issues, and could potentially get more involved in partisan politics.

Mayer noted that for some religious leaders, the IRS rule has given them a way to avoid political pressure for an endorsement.

“Now a church that wants to say no has an easy answer, it’s illegal,” Mayer said.

Repeal does not appear to have widespread public support. Eight in 10 Americans said it was inappropriate for pastors to endorse a candidate in church in a poll released last September by Lifeway Research, a religious survey firm based in Nashville.

For many religious conservatives, a more pressing issue they hope he will address is protection for faith-based charities, schools and ministries who object to same-sex marriage and abortion.

The president made no mention at the prayer breakfast of other steps he may take, saying only that religious freedom is a “sacred right.”

Kelly Shackelford, head of First Liberty Institute, a non-profit legal group that specializes in religious freedom cases said that “there’s a number of things he laid out that we expect we’ll eventually see action on.”

Trump also defended his recent executive order on immigration, decrying “generous” immigration policies and arguing that there are people who seek to enter the country “for the purpose of spreading violence or oppressing other people based upon their faith.” He also pledged to take more immigration action in the name of religious liberty.

“In the coming days we will develop a system to help ensure that those admitted into our country fully embrace our values of religious and personal liberty and that they reject any form of oppression and discrimination,” Trump said.

LGBTQ groups have been anxious that the president could use his executive powers to curb legal advances they have made. Emily Hecht-McGowan, chief policy officer for the Family Equality Council, said that she was “anticipating more to come,” noting that some draft documents have been circulating, suggesting plans for a more sweeping order.

White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Thursday that “there’s nothing new on that front.”

Earlier this week, the Trump administration announced that the president would leave intact a 2014 executive order that protects workers for federal contractors from anti-LGBTQ discrimination, saying in a statement that Trump “continues to be respectful and supportive of LGBTQ rights, just as he was throughout the election.”

Religious conservatives, who saw a series of defeats on same-sex marriage, abortion and other issues under former President Barack Obama, have been bolstered by Trump’s win. In a letter last year to Roman Catholics, Trump pledged, “I will defend your religious liberties and the right to fully and freely practice your religion, as individuals, business owners and academic institutions.”

Trump’s Supreme Court pick this week was also considered a positive sign for conservatives.

A favorite of conservatives, Neil Gorsuch serves on the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, where he sided with Hobby Lobby and the Little Sisters of the Poor when they mounted religious objections to the Obama administration’s requirement that employers provide health insurance that includes contraceptives.

During his remarks, Trump also took a dig at Arnold Schwarzenegger, the new host of “The Apprentice,” the reality TV show Trump previously headlined. Trump said that since Schwarzenegger took over, the show’s ratings have been down, and he asked the audience to “pray for Arnold.” Schwarzenegger tweeted in response that he and Trump should switch jobs and Americans would sleep better.

 U.S. thermal coal markets started the year off on a sour note, but industry prices started to bounce off their lows around June or so. And all of the major coal basins were were following suit by October, which helps explain the impressive 2016 price gains for coal miners like Cloud Peak Energy (NYSE:CLD), Westmoreland Coal (NASDAQ:WLB), and Alliance Resource Partners, L.P. (NASDAQ:ARLP).

But after coal miner stocks rocketed by as much as 200%, can this coal rally keep going? The answer appears to be shaky at best -- here's why.

Energy issues

Thermal coal is used as a fuel in power plants. The headlines have been filled for years with the growth of solar and wind power, but the real issue for coal has been low natural gas prices. Utilities have increasingly opted to build cleaner burning gas plants as they retire older, less efficient coal facilities, and that's led to a long-term decline in demand for thermal coal. To put some numbers on that, Cloud Peak Energy's coal shipments have fallen from 95.6 million tons in 2011 to an expected 57 to 60 million tons in 2016.

Along with that hit, prices have dropped. Alliance Resource Partners, for example, saw its coal sales price fall nearly 9% year over year in the fourth quarter of 2016, and around 3% sequentially from the third quarter. (The price rebound for the Illinois Coal Basin coal it mines didn't start to pick up until October.) Although Alliance saw a volume boost in the fourth quarter, overall lower volumes and lower sales prices throughout the industry were so damaging during the downturn that the industry saw a slew of bankruptcies, including global coal giant Peabody Energy. But the first half of 2016 was really just a continuation of a years-long trend.

After so much pain, then, it isn't shocking that coal miner stocks rallied when coal prices started to stabilize. And the election of Donald Trump also helped, since he's been a vocal supporter of the coal industry. In fact, Westmoreland Coal's stock wildly outdistanced the others here following the elections.

Different animals

In contrast, Cloud Peak Energy's shares ended the year on a weak note. The fact of the matter is that these four coal miners offer vastly different ways to invest in the industry. Cloud Peak, for example, is focused exclusively on the Powder River basin, an area that's expected to see relatively weak demand going forward. The rally in that stock was based on improving export demand, as Chinese production cuts lifted seaborne coal prices.

A big part of Cloud Peak's story has been the opportunity to export coal. Only that market hasn't been nearly as robust as expected just a few years ago. It's no surprise that investors got excited when it looked like exports might pick up, and then flipped back to a negative view when seaborne coal prices started to decline again early in 2017. The shares have recovered from that early year pullback and are now up again, but of these four, Cloud Peak likely has the riskiest investment profile.

Alliance Resource Partners and its general partner, Alliance Holdings GP (NASDAQ:AHGP), sit on the other side of this equation. This miner is focused on the Illinois Basin coal region, where demand is expected to pick up over time as it gains market share from other domestic regions because of the nature of its coal. Fourth quarter shipments were actually near record levels in the fourth quarter.

These two limited partnerships have actually held up relatively well compared to peers. Alliance's bottom line, for example, has remained in the black throughout the coal industry's downturn. Moreover, it covered its distribution, which it trimmed in early 2016, by around two times last year. That's a huge amount of coverage in the LP space, and backs up the company's earlier comments that the distribution cut was really meant to appease worried lenders, and not a business necessity.

Then there's Westmoreland, which focuses on owning coal mines that are next to the power plants they serve. It benefits from long-term contracts with dedicated customers. The biggest driver of the company's stock has been from the expectation that, under the new president, coal power plants will face less stringent regulation.

In other words, the plants Westmoreland supplies are expected to remain running longer now that Trump is president than they might have had someone else been elected. It's little wonder that this stock's gain led the pack here, with most of the price advance taking place in the final months of 2016. The big unknown here is if Trump will live up to his political promises.

It's about more than surviving

The thermal coal miners that didn't go bankrupt because of low coal prices staged an impressive rally last year. The big push was an improvement in the price of the fuel during the second half of 2016. However, there's a lot of moving parts to this picture that suggest some miners are better positioned than others for the years ahead. On that score, Alliance Resource Partners and its general partner, Alliance Holdings GP, are the best positioned to do well in 2017 and beyond.

Westmoreland Coal, meanwhile, has a solid business, but there's notable political risk. And Cloud Peak Energy operates in a weakening coal region, and foreign demand -- which is often volatile -- is a notable factor in its future. It's got the worst outlook of these four coal miners at this point. Rex Tillerson takes up the reins at the State Dept. amid an extraodinary show of dissent and displeasure from within the diplomatic corps. that will now work for the former Exxon Mobil CEO. WASHINGTON - Republicans this week kicked off their drive to roll back Obama-era environmental regulations by repealing a "Stream Protection Rule" meant to keep coal mines from dumping waste into streams.

The U.S. Senate approved the measure Thursday in a 54 to 45 vote that went largely along party lines, with backing from Ohio GOP Sen. Rob Portman, and a "no" vote from Ohio Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown.

The House of Representatives approved it 228 to 194 on Wednesday, with support from all Ohio's Republicans and opposition from all of the state's Democrats.

I will be on @cspan at 2:40 PM to speak on House Joint Resolution 38 & need to protect OH jobs & electricity costs.https://t.co/Z7zw1jmasc -- Rep. Jim Renacci (@RepJimRenacci) February 1, 2017

Marietta Republican Rep. Bill Johnson - who introduced the measure - said the stream protection rule was "designed for one purpose--to regulate the coal mining industry out of business. It is the centerpiece of the Obama administration's war on coal."

Democrats argued the rule was needed to protect the health of people who live near mines from hazards like lung cancer, heart disease, kidney disease, birth defects, hypertension, and other problems caused by open pit mine runoff.

"If this body is seriously going to weaken vital drinking water protections, the American people deserve ample opportunities to inform themselves and to make their voices heard," said Virginia Democratic Rep. Donald McEachin. "This rushed-through proposal denies them that opportunity.

The repeal was hailed by mining interests, who said they expected President Donald Trump will swiftly sign it.

"The alleged 'Stream Protection Rule,' was never about the environment and was always about carrying out the previous administrations radical anti coal agenda," said a statement from Ohio Coal Association President Christian Palich. "If implemented the rule would have killed thousands of jobs, while depriving families' access to affordable energy."

Environmental groups like the League of Conservation Voters said the repeal shows the GOP-led Congress was making sure "federal government works for Big Polluters above all else."

"This is simply the first step in President Trump's war on clean water and the environment more broadly," said a statement from the organization's president, Gene Karpinski. Coal-miner CONSOL Energy (NYSE:CNX) did not have a great 2016.

In its earnings report released on January 31, 2017, CONSOL confessed to investors that Q4 "earnings" of negative $302 million marked a sharp reversal from last year's $34 million Q4 profit. For the year, CONSOL reported combined net losses of $839 million, or $3.70 per diluted share -- more than twice what it lost in 2015.

Hoping to right the ship in the new year, CONSOL confirmed that it is "pursuing ... the possible sale of the coal business to a third party or the spin-off of the coal business to CONSOL's shareholders," and hopes to effect such a divestiture before the end of this year. And yet, this poses an existential dilemma for CONSOL shareholders. Historically, CONSOL Energy has always been considered to be first and foremost a coal mining stock.

So if CONSOL divests itself of coal, what exactly will it have left?

After ditching coal ...

In 2016, CONSOL reported total sales of $2 billion from all its divisions, down 25% year over year. Of these revenues, coal sales accounted for a bit less than $1.1 billion of the business, while sales of oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids made up $793 million. The balance of CONSOL's revenue was attributed to such activities as "purchased gas sales," "freight-outside coal," and "other outside sales."

So basically, a divestiture of CONSOL's coal business will cut the company in half, and cut company revenues by 52.5%. Which sounds like a lot -- until you take a look at the data on S&P Global Market Intelligence, and realize coal sales have already dropped 38% since 2014 even without any divestiture.

... what remains?

Ex-coal, CONSOL should continue doing about $800 million to $900 million in business focusing primarily on oil and gas exploration and production. CONSOL probably won't be earning profit on these revenues even after coal is removed from the picture, however. Here's why not:

According to CONSOL's consolidated statements of income, oil and gas exploration and production activities incurred $1.2 billion in operating costs last year, which is already more than the revenues the oil and gas business is bringing in. Now let's assume that roughly half of the company's $400 million in "other costs" incurred also belong to the oil and gas business.

Voila! CONSOL Energy, ex-coal, is probably going to be running at least a $500 million operating deficit ($900 million in revenues, minus $1.4 billion in costs) after any spin-off.

How do you value something like this?

So how much might a coal-less CONSOL Energy be worth? That's hard to say. Valued on sales, traditional oil and gas companies like ExxonMobil, Conoco, and Chevron are selling for anywhere from 1.8 times sale to 2.6 times sales today. Apply that valuation to CONSOL's $900 million or less in oil and gas revenue and you get a fair valuation of at most $2.3 billion for CONSOL after it ditches its coal business.

Of course, CONSOL stock costs $3.9 billion today, which would seem to imply that the coal business CONSOL wants to get rid of is worth as much as $1.6 billion -- which is quite simply a fantastic (as in, unrealistic) valuation.

There aren't a whole lot of publicly traded coal companies left standing to compare CONSOL's coal business to today (because most have gone bankrupt already). But two companies with similar-sized coal revenues, SunCoke Energy (NYSE:SWC) and Cloud Peak Energy (NYSE:CLD), are still in business. SunCoke stock sells for 0.46 times sales, while Cloud Peak gets 0.44x sales for its shares. Applying a similar 0.45x sales valuation to CONSOL's coal business implies a fair value of only about $400 million -- one quarter of $1.6 billion.

What it means for investors

What we're left with, then, is a difficult question: If CONSOL's oil and gas business is worth $2.3 billion, and its coal business perhaps $400 million, then ... where does the remaining $1.2 billion in CONSOL's market capitalization go?

And the answer to that question is that I honestly don't know. Perhaps the remaining "value" wasn't there to begin with. After all, CONSOL shares have more than doubled in price over the past year, and that increase in price certainly didn't come from any bull market in coal. It could be that, after separating its coal business from its oil and gas business, CONSOL shareholders will be greeted by the unpleasant prospect of the value of both businesses declining as investors get a clearer view of the troubles facing both businesses.

In fact, given the trajectory the shares have been taking these past few days, I'd say that scenario is more likely than not.  On Thursday, President Donald Trump announced that he wanted to ensure that the nuclear arsenal of the U.S. was “top of the pack.” He said the U.S. has dropped behind in weapons capacity.

Non solo per i controlli, ma anche l’alto numero di deroghe previste nella delibere-fotocopia dei Comuni del blocco. A partire dalla più importante: la finestra, ad esempio, aperta per i residenti di quel comune nei giorni di martedì, mercoledì e giovedì dalle 10 alle 16. Inoltre possono mettersi alla guida dei veicoli (anche se Euro 3) conducenti che abbiano già compiuto i 65 anni. Altri esempi di deroghe? Ci sono i veicoli di farmacisti titolari in servizio limitatamente un’ora prima e un’ora dopo l’apertura o la chiusura dell’attività, i veicoli di giornalisti, delle autoscuole e dei candidati all’esame guida, e quelli delle persone che per andare al lavoro non possono non possono usare mezzi pubblici (ad esempio perché entrano in servizio quando non ce ne sono), e poi i veicoli con almeno 3 persone a bordo, quelli degli operatori commerciali per andare ai mercati, quelli degli agenti di commercio, e quelli degli avvocati impegnati per difese di ufficio per «provvedimenti limitanti libertà o urgenti eo procedimenti penali». Altre deroghe riguardano i mezzi adibiti al trasporto merci, autoveicoli per il trasporto in conto proprio o conto terzi intestati a imprese per l’esercizio di attività commerciali, artigianali o industriali, o per il trasporto di attrezzature di lavoro. E poi ancora i veicoli usati per l’accompagnamento degli alunni di asili nido, scuole materne, scuole elementari e scuole medie inferiori, limitatamente ai 30 minuti prima e dopo l’orario di entrata e uscita del minore. C’è una deroga anche per i veicoli di trasporto collettivo delle società sportive per l’accompagnamento di giovani atleti (massima categoria giovanissimi) verso le strutture sportive, «limitatamente al percorso casa-impianto sportivo e limitatamente ai 60 minuti prima e dopo l’inizio e la fine degli allenamenti». Insomma, basta

cercare bene, e c’è praticamente una deroga per tutti.

Riscaldamento. Il raggiungimento dell’allerta prevede anche il divieto, di utilizzare tutti gli impianti e apparecchi di riscaldamento civili alimentati a biomassa, almeno che non siano gli unici sistemi di riscaldamento presenti.

No chain drugstore in Oakland has generated as much enthusiasm or consternation as the planned Walgreens that broke ground this week in a low-income neighborhood not far from Mills College.

The 27,000-square-foot store will anchor a development that represents the first significant retail investment in the area in more than two decades, city officials say. The project is scheduled to create 125 jobs, 54 of which will be permanent, in a neighborhood that has long grappled with crime.

“This neighborhood has been plagued with addiction for years,” said Dwayne MacArthur, who runs a charter tour bus company across the street from the Walgreens site at Foothill Boulevard and Seminary Avenue. “With jobs in the area, a child might decide to go work at Walgreens because he has an opportunity other than standing on that corner over there selling drugs.”

On Monday, MacArthur was among the business owners and residents who showed up for a groundbreaking ceremony after waiting nearly a decade through false starts and setbacks that punctuated the path from empty lot to shopping center.

“I know that we’ve been waiting for a long time,” Councilwoman Desley Brooks told a group of 60 or so community members before picking up a ceremonial shovel. “I want everybody — everybody — to say, ‘Finally.’”

“Finally!” chorused back the crowd.

The shopping center will have space for about half a dozen businesses in addition to the pharmacy. In a city that already has plenty of drugstores, including nine other Walgreens locations, Brooks and other promoters of the project say this one will benefit the elderly and youth who can’t drive or walk long distances.

To help revitalize the area ahead of construction, the city poured money into repairing the surrounding streets — putting in new sidewalks, gutters, trees and old-fashioned street lamps. Their efforts didn’t go unnoticed.

Outside a convenience store across the street, Marlin Godfrey Jr., who runs a nonprofit, and his friend and barber shop owner Don Tutson talked about how the composition of the community might change as new retail comes in, concluding that a little gentrification would be tolerable in order to stem the gang violence. Godfrey pointed out a line of colorful flags affixed to the new street lamps overhead reading “eat, drink, shop, play,” along with the name of a merchants group in the corridor.

“I guess this is the Heartlands now,” he said, reading one. A third friend riding his bike overheard and interjected, “Nah, man, this will always be the Seminary.”

Godfrey corrected the friend as he rode away, “Nah, man, look at the flags.”

To deal with the difficulty of attracting business to the site, the city gave the project $14 million in federal tax credits. And City Council members at one point even considered waiving a requirement that Walgreens pay its workers Oakland’s living wage, now nearly $15 per hour, before the company withdrew its request to be exempted from the ordinance.

The millions of dollars in tax credits, according to the project’s backers, are needed to bridge the gap between how much construction will cost and how much business tenants are willing to pay in rent. New Markets Tax Credit, a federal program designed to spur economic growth in low-income communities, is filling in the shortfall.

“These types of tenants we can attract here are not what we can attract, let’s say, in downtown Oakland or downtown San Francisco or Walnut Creek,” said Larry Gallegos, a development program manager for the city. “You still have the same type of construction costs as we do here, but over there they can at least attract higher on the actual leases.”

On top of persuading Walgreens to anchor the site, the project was stalled by obstacles large and small, like the 2011 dissolution of the city’s redevelopment agency and later the discovery of lead and hydrocarbons in the soil of the lot.

“At first it was frustrating,” said Yakpasua Zazaboi, who owns a computer repair store nearby. “We can’t just stick a shovel in and start building, I understand that now.”

Verdadeiramente novo é a rápida aceleração dessa mesma mudança. As duas revoluções industriais demoraram cumulativamente quase dois séculos a ganhar expressão consolidada no que era, então, o “mundo desenvolvido”. Em contraste, no último quarto de século os processos revolucionários na economia sucederam-se, atingindo quase de imediato uma expressão global.

Hoje, o paradigma de que a oferta cria a sua própria procura já não é válido. Pelo contrário, é esta última que, cada vez mais, determina a evolução da oferta. A consequência disto é que aos agentes económicos já não basta serem capazes de se adaptar à mudança e é quase sempre fundamental antecipá-la. O que significa captar e interpretar o impacto dos novos modos de vida nas formas de organização individual e colectiva que promovem e que se uniformizam à escala do planeta.

Foi com base nesta leitura da realidade que a CCP decidiu, há quatro anos, promover a criação de uma plataforma aberta que juntasse associações, empresas e pessoas do mundo académico e da investigação, com o propósito de impulsionar o estudo, o debate e a dinamização de acções de eficiência colectiva. Escolhemos como ponto de partida as grandes tendências da economia à escala global e a forma como o nosso país nelas se podia integrar, visando ascender na cadeia de valor daquilo que produzimos e vendemos. Ao contrário do que parece ter sucedido com parte dos utilizadores das redes sociais e demais plataformas, a entrevista com um dos donos da Padaria Portuguesa, no âmbito da qual este expressou o desejo de uma (ainda) maior flexibilização do Direito do Trabalho, maxime quanto às normas dos despedimentos e à eliminação de um período máximo de trabalho, não me surpreendeu.

Cliente irregular de alguns dos estabelecimentos que operam sob esta marca, não tenho quaisquer ilusões sobre o que querem, afinal e no final, os empregadores. Ao invés, o que me deixou atónita foi, por um lado, a “inocência” subjacente às afirmações proferidas e, por outro, as reacções absolutamente extremadas que, infelizmente, tive oportunidade de ler. Sob a justificação de que é melhor um péssimo a nenhum emprego, alguns dos comentadores defendem, aparentemente mais do que o visado, a abolição de quaisquer regras, como se só a escravatura, imagino eu que destinada a todos os demais que não os próprios, pudesse salvar o país.

A este título, importará que se assinale que, ao contrário do que se afirma reiteradamente, não existe qualquer demonstração de que a desregulamentação crie mais e, muito menos, melhor emprego. Contudo, mais relevante ainda me parece ser a particular circunstância de, em Portugal, a ineficácia de um controlo efectivo do cumprimento das ditas normas gerar um sentimento de total impunidade aos infractores. Em síntese, quantos e quantos trabalhadores portugueses têm um horário contratado de 40 horas semanais mas, na realidade, cumprem muito mais do que estas, sem receberem por isso? Não se desconhecendo a proibição dos despedimentos sem justa causa, quantos e quantos trabalhadores conseguiram manter o seu posto de trabalho quando a empresa decidiu fazer cessar, sem qualquer fundamento bastante, o contrato? De uma forma mais genérica, de que vale termos uma qualquer legislação se, na prática, é ignorada a cada passo? Não será esta a verdadeira questão, consubstanciando a entrevista ao dito senhor um fait-divers?  REGGIO EMILIA. L’edilizia può risorgere a Reggio Emilia. Il volano sarà lo sviluppo dell’area nord, che è già partito e farà diventare la nostra città l’epicentro di un nuovo risiko immobiliare che va però gestito visti i trascorsi sia dal punto di vista finanziario e industriale, sia dal punto di vista della legalità. L’arrivo di progetti e capitali è un’opportunità inquadrata chiaramente dalla cooperazione reggiana, come avverte Luca Bosi, presidente della società edile Sicrea e vicepresidente di Legacoop Emilia Ovest. Sigla che aggrega Reggio, Parma e Piacenza, e che collima con il perimetro della recente fusione delle Camere di Commercio, sulla quale Bosi rivendica l’accelerazione decisiva e su cui punta per ampliare la regia dello sviluppo territoriale su più grande scala. Chi rimarrà sul mercato - sia a livello economico sia a livello politico - potrà dettare l’agenda e trarne benefici.

Bosi, Legacoop è tra gli azionisti di maggioranza del progetto di fusione della Camera di Commercio. Missione compiuta per voi?

«Direi di sì. Si stava perdendo troppo tempo su questa fusione che ritenevamo necessaria. Noi abbiamo spinto affinché ci fosse anche Modena che poi ha detto di no. Ma attendere, per noi reggiani, poteva significare che Parma e Piacenza sarebbero andati insieme, costringendoci ad andare poi da Modena con il cappello in mano».

Com’è la suddivisione tra le province?

«Reggio porta in dote il più alto numero di imprese nella nuova Camera dell’Emilia Ovest: avremo i primi tre anni di presidenza e un membro in più all’interno della giunta».

Quindi comandiamo noi ?

«Non è quello l’obiettivo. Lo era la fusione in sè. Dovevamo anticipare le decisioni che la politica in questo momento non sta prendendo. Sulle aree vaste si discuterà ancora cent’anni, i risultati sulle unioni dei comuni sono noti e quando faranno i referendum li perderanno tutti se non cambia culturalmente l’approccio. L’economia deve necessariamente anticipare i progetti di aggregazione e lo sta facendo. Pensare ancora a delle Camere di Commercio su scala provinciale era una fesseria».

Come vi suddividerete i 10 posti in consiglio tra reggiani?

«La nuova Camera dell’Emilia Ovest sarà operativa dal primo gennaio 2018. Io credo che con 10 posti in consiglio tutte le organizzazioni reggiane saranno rappresentate. Il problema è la giunta. È un po’ presto per capire gli apparentamenti. Certo per noi avere già Legacoop Emilia Ovest è un punto di forza perché siamo già un soggetto unico. Abbiamo grande forza per immaginare di avere in quella giunta un nostro rappresentante. Ma non faremo nessuna battaglia per averlo».

Tutti d’accordo su Stefano Landi ancora presidente?

«Allo stato attuale sì, non vedo defezioni».

La sede a Parma: cosa significa per i reggiani?

«Niente. In una prima fase ecumenica hanno detto che si terranno anche dei consigli itineranti. Poi all’isolato San Rocco restano tutt i servizi».

Cosa succederà invece ai dipendenti e alla compresenza di tre segretari generali?

«Secondo me per i tre segretari valuteremo il merito e il più bravo sarà confermato post fusione. Ma dobbiamo venirci incontro sul metro di valutazione chiaramente».

Parla di sviluppo: bene il parlamentino economico ma ci sono nodi da affrontare, come l’area nord. Reggio Emilia è al centro di una crescita potente innescata dal volano infrastrutturale che dovrà essere calibrata, anche negli appetiti. Che interesse ha la cooperazione rispetto a quel risiko?

«Mi sembra che adesso si stia passando da una fase passiva a una attiva. Nessuno, un anno fa, riteneva che lì ci potesse essere un’esplosione di questo genere. Ma le potenzialità verranno espresse con i servizi. Chi dice che la Mediopadana è un hub dice una sciocchezza, la si riduce in un luogo di passaggio. Quella stazione sta iniziando a essere un magnete. È comoda perché fuori dalla città. Però ho la sensazione che sia appoggiata lì, con associazioni e politica che non hanno capito la portata di quella operazione. Perché la concepivano su un’asse di comodità tra Roma e Milano: in verità quello è un asse che collega tutta l’Italia con l’Europa. Adesso si stanno cominciando a fare dei ragionamenti ma anche qui bisogna accelerare».

Di quali servizi parla?

«Chi arriva in Mediopadana non ha appoggi, è senza wifi o un posto dove fare un riunione. Si chieda alle Ferrovie di concedere gli spazi vuoti sotto la stazione. Non bastano i parcheggi e il servizio taxi. Quella stazione è interessante per chi arriva lì e vuole andare a Modena o a Verona. Italo ci ha provato ma non sembra che vada un granché bene. Servono servizi dedicati per chi arriva per affari. Un piano sui servizi elementari come uffici temporanei, logistica con grandi partner, transfer dedicati. Per svoltare bisogna rivolgersi a imprese e investitori privati. Il pubblico ha già fatto tutto quello che poteva fare».

Non tutto procede. Poco più in là ci sono spazi semivuoti come le fiere rimaste al palo. Cosa ne pensate?

«Io non le abbandonerei. Bisogna semmai convertirle. Mi sembra, ad esempio, che questa esperienza del Lime Theater sia ottima. Non capisco le polemiche attorno a questo progetto: qualcuno che va dentro e riutilizza dei capannoni lasciati lì dovrebbe essere sostenuto. Il polo fieristico va gestito cercando di capire se l’idea del presidente Bonaccini di costituire un unico soggetto per tutti i poli fieristici regionali è reale».

Però non si sente nominare Reggio Emilia.

«Se non parte quello facciamo un ragionamento strutturato con fiere di Parma, data proprio la fusione delle Camere di Commercio».

In poco spazio ci sono il Lime Theater, il progetto dell’Arena concerti, quello della sala WeArena. Non stiamo già rischiando una bolla?

«Sono modelli complementari. Al Campovolo si punta al vasto pubblico da 100 mila persone. WeArena punta a 7mila e i promotori pensano a un modello di intrattenimento più vario. Potrebbe fare da volano per la creazione di nuove aziende innovative, che in area nord credo saranno di grande interesse. Vorrei invece che la nostra città non mettesse in antitesi questi progetti complementari».

Il problema è che spesso la politica vuole mettere il cappello su tutto.

«Le istituzioni facciano da soggetto regolatore. Quello è il loro ruolo».

Attorno ci sono aree private: una, tra le più grandi, è di Coop Alleanza. Il vostro mondo è il primo ad avere interessi lì nel risiko.

«Il ruolo di Legacoop è mettere insieme coop che hanno interessi in quell’area perché possono offrire servizi o perché, come Alleanza, hanno delle aree e ragionare insieme su quale tipo di progetto fare. Perché magari Coopservice vuole gestire dei servizi, la Cir food l’area ristorazione, Alleanza 3.0 vuole smobilizzare ma forse dandogli più valore dell’attuale senza vendere e basta».

La prospettiva è ghiotta ma servono spalle forti. Anche secondo lei vale il concetto che nella cooperazione serve un unico soggetto nell’edilizia? Ma chi tra Unieco e la sua Sicrea?

«Io penso solo che saranno necessari grandi investimenti. Io sto gestendo un’azienda che viene da dei concordati. Visto anche la prospettiva dell’area nord bisogna continuare a crederci in questo settore. C’è

un mercato e c’è una possibilità di sviluppo dopo quasi 10 anni di crisi. Ma dobbiamo giocare d’anticipo. Abbiamo sempre detto che il problema era l’immobiliare. Ora qualcosa si sta muovendo ma serve un soggetto attivo in grado di offrire opere chiavi in mano».

©RIPRODUZIONE RISERVATA  NEW YORK — Stefan Larsson, who took over as CEO at Ralph Lauren Corp. less than two years ago in hopes of revitalizing the iconic brand, is leaving the company.

The namesake founder, who said at the time that Larsson “understands what dreams are,” maintains that he pushed the company in the right direction.

However, the two clashed largely over creative control. Lauren says the decision to part ways is mutual. Larsson – who also serves as president – will remain with the New York company until May. The search for a new chief executive is underway. The company’s chief financial officer, Jane Nielsen, will lead the company’s plan to turn around its business while a successor is found.

“Stefan and I share a love and respect for the DNA of this great brand, and we both recognize the need to evolve,” said Lauren, executive chairman and chief creative officer. “However, we have found that we have different views on how to evolve the creative and consumer-facing parts of the business.”

Larsson said Thursday that the differences came down to different views on product, marketing and the shopping experience. He noted that he spent his entire career in family-controlled businesses and “worked hard to find common ground.” The Budget focuses on several of the economic and social goals that the Modi government has been pursuing.

Finance minister Arun Jaitley has delivered a Budget that ticks several boxes. The Budget focuses on several of the economic and social goals that the Modi government has been pursuing, such as attracting foreign direct investment, reducing black money in the economy, skilling the youth, boosting rural infrastructure, encouraging medium and small enterprises (MSMEs) and creating a digital economy.

The demonetisation move just a couple of months ago had raised expectations of a bold, game-changing Budget. The finance minister, however, presented a balanced one and operated with fiscal prudence within his zone of comfort. The upsides provided by the impending GST implementation as well as imminent remonetisation perhaps explain this cautious approach. There were certainly no negative surprises, and those pleased the stock market, with the Sensex responding with a nearly 500-point rally.

Fiscal prudence

Given rising crude oil prices and challenges on the revenue front, the finance minister decided to balance between growth expectations and fiscal prudence. He, therefore, pegged the fiscal deficit for the next fiscal at 3.2% of the GDP and reiterated his commitment to achieving 3% in the next year.

Abolition of FIPB

The decision to abolish the FIPB is a good step and shows India’s openness to FDI at a time when protectionism is increasing around the world. The government had earlier taken several initiatives to attract more foreign capital into the country, including easing FDI caps across several sectors. These measures are already showing results, as FDI inflows grew 36% year-on-year in the first half of the current fiscal, despite a 5% reduction in global FDI inflows. This is a positive sign as reduced uncertainty about foreign capital outflows can help control currency volatility.

Cleaning up political funding

The FM’s initiatives to clean up political funding, including the innovative step of introducing electoral bonds is welcome. I think it will pave the way for transparency in political funding.

Boosting rural economy

Equally laudable is the move by the government to tackle distress in the rural economy by giving a push to market reforms in agriculture, increased funding for crop insurance and setting a higher target for agricultural credit in the Budget. The government has earmarked Rs 10 lakh crore towards farm credit in the next fiscal. To help farmers get better value for their produce, the Budget talked about a model law on contract farming and reiterated the government’s earlier goal of bringing in more regulated agriculture markets on the electronic National Agriculture Market (e-NAM) platform. Overall, funding for the rural and agriculture sector has been increased by 24%.

It was quite heartening to see the intent on setting up of digital infrastructure using high-speed broad-band optic fibre network to provide internet access to rural India. More than 150,000 gram panchayats will be equipped with broad band connectivity by the end of the next fiscal.

Digital economy

The Budget should also be appreciated for its focus on introducing measures that will push greater adoption of electronic payments and will enable India’s move towards being a large digital economy which is less cash dependent. The capping of cash transactions up to a maximum of Rs 3 lakh is a big bold step that will compel people to move to digital payments.

‘Aadhar Pay’, a merchant version of Aadhar-enabled payment system, is proposed to be launched shortly. Also, certain exemptions related to excise and customs for devices and equipment required for digitisation will aid this transition.
